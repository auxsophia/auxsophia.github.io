This website is the open notebook of [Elliott Collin Ploutz](/about/). I am a philosopher, computer scientist, and aspiring influencer. These pages are my public notes on various topics I investigate. If you're interested in living a good life, optimizing productivity, philosophy, computer science, artificial intelligence, and making sense of this absurd universe we live in, I hope something on this site saves you time and energy.
