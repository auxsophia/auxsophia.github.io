        My name is Elliott Collin Ploutz.
        <br>
        Date of Birth: February 22nd, 1991
        <br><br>
        I started college at age 16 with the College of Southern Nevada High School program.
        Graduating high school in 2009, I began studying at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in the fall of 2009.
        I completed a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy in the spring of 2012.
        My first corporate job was pretty normal; I hated it. Turns out real life is terrible.
        After talking to my brother, I did the <a href="/pages/philosophy/sevenLive.html">seven lives</a> experiment.
        <br><br>
        I realized I wanted to do artificial intelligence research. I quit work and went back to school in the summer of 2013.
        I graduated with a bachelor's of science degree in computer science in the spring of 2016. In the fall of 2016,
        I began my master of science degree in computer science also at UNLV.
