    <h1>Arguments</h1>
    <p>
      I'm trying a different kind of project. I often debate with people over the internet and use many of the same arguments over and over.
      Instead of wasting time and energy reconstructing arguments, I want to write well thought out arguments to be copied and pasted as needed.
      his will also put my reasoning on public display, so anyone can criticize it. This way I'll be less likely to fall into poor reasoning.
      I'll also be able to see how my views change over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, I may try to give a very brief version of the argument followed by a more in depth one, so I can use either depending
      on the situation. I will update as the arguments arise along with free time.
