I've listened to audiobook versions of two of [Naomi Klein's](https://naomiklein.org/) (journalist, author, filmmaker, activist) books, [_This Changes Everything: Capitalism versus Climate_](https://naomiklein.org/this-changes-everything/) and [_On Fire: The (Burning) Case for the Green New Deal_](https://naomiklein.org/on-fire/).

## This Changes Everything: Capitalism versus Climate

"Climate change isn’t just another issue to be neatly filed between taxes and health care. It’s an alarm that calls us to fix an economic system that is already failing us in many ways. Klein meticulously builds the case for how massively reducing our greenhouse emissions is our best chance to simultaneously reduce gaping inequalities, re-imagine our broken democracies, and rebuild our gutted local economies. She exposes the ideological desperation of the climate-change deniers, the messianic delusions of the would-be geoengineers, and the tragic defeatism of too many mainstream green initiatives. And she demonstrates precisely why the market has not—and cannot—fix the climate crisis but will instead make things worse, with ever more extreme and ecologically damaging extraction methods, accompanied by rampant disaster capitalism.

Klein argues that the changes to our relationship with nature and one another that are required to respond to the climate crisis humanely should not be viewed as grim penance, but rather as a kind of gift—a catalyst to transform broken economic and cultural priorities and to heal long-festering historical wounds. And she documents the inspiring movements that have already begun this process: communities that are not just refusing to be sites of further fossil fuel extraction but are building the next, regeneration-based economies right now.

Forget everything you think you know about global warming. It’s not about carbon—it’s about capitalism. The most profound threat to humanity is the war our economic model is waging against life on earth. Yet we can seize this existential crisis to transform our failed economic system into something radically better.

Klein exposes the myths that are clouding the climate debate.  We have been told the market will save us, when in fact the addiction to profit and growth is digging us in deeper every day. We have been told it’s impossible to get off fossil fuels when in fact we know exactly how to do it—it just requires breaking every rule in the “free-market” playbook: reining in corporate power, rebuilding local economies, and reclaiming our democracies.

We have also been told that humanity is too greedy and selfish to rise to this challenge. In fact, all around the world, the fight for the next economy and against reckless extraction is already succeeding in ways both surprising and inspiring.

Can we pull off these changes in time? Nothing is certain. Nothing except that climate change changes everything. And for a very brief time, the nature of that change is still up to us."

The book is separated into 3 parts, the ideology that stops us from acting properly and distorts thinking, the magical thinking that prevents us from panicking, and climate activists and battles making a difference.

She discusses right-wing politics and their contribution to the climate crisis. However, she praises them for correctly understanding the radical shift in thinking we need in the economy to fix the issues. Right-wingers scream terror over the climate change plot to redistribute wealth, which, yes, that's a huge part of what we **need** to do. Capitalism is supporting and expanding the climate crisis while profiting.

A little too close to home, she argues many deniers have a messiah or superhero complex that we will be saved by technology, scientists, or billionaires at the last moment. She notes the failure of mergers between green technology and big business. Some companies taking donations to fight climate change are even extracting oils themselves, worsening the problem, all while under the banner of a green company. Pollution laws are being exploited. Companies can earn money by disposing of harmful pollutants, but companies are profiting off of the disposal of pollutants they unnecessarily added to their production simply to cash in on the government subsidies. 90% of one company's profits were from burning pollutants they created.

Finally she gets into the fights that matter and what the most successful battles have been. Many island countries feel the threat of climate collapse now and have had to fight for their way of life. She reports on indigenous rights and indigenous fights against fossil fuel companies.

Overall, her book is an insightful, in-depth analysis of the past and emerging current of the climate crisis and some of what needs to happen to avoid the worst catastrophes.

## On Fire: The (Burning) Case for the Green New Deal

"For more than a decade, Naomi Klein has documented the movement of the climate crisis from future threat to a burning emergency.  She has been among the first to make the case for what is now called the Green New Deal – a vision for transforming our economies to battle climate breakdown and rampant inequality at the same time. In our era of rising seas and rising hate, she argues that only this kind of bold, roots-up action has a chance of rousing us to fight for our lives while there is still time.

On Fire’s long-form essays, based on her extensive research and reporting, show Klein at her most prophetic and philosophical, investigating the climate crisis not only as a profound political challenge but as a spiritual and imaginative one as well. Delving into the clash between ecological time and our culture of “perpetual now”; the soaring history of rapid human change in the face of grave threats; rising white supremacy and fortressed borders as a form of “climate barbarism” and more, this is a rousing call to transformation – and a dire warning about what awaits if we fail to act.

With dispatches from the ghostly Great Barrier Reef to the smoke-choked skies of the Pacific Northwest, to post-hurricane Puerto Rico, to a Vatican waking up to the case for radical change, recognizing that we will rise to the existential challenge of climate change only if we are willing to transform the systems that produced this crisis — On Fire captures the burning urgency of the climate crisis, as well as the fiery energy of a global movement demanding a catalytic Green New Deal."



Either we leap—or we sink."
