"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (previously titled Guns, Germs and Steel: A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13,000 Years) is a 1997 transdisciplinary non-fiction book by Jared Diamond, professor of geography and physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1998, Guns, Germs, and Steel won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. A documentary based on the book, and produced by the National Geographic Society, was broadcast on PBS in July 2005." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel)

I can absolutely see why this book inspired [Sapiens](/sapiens/). Diamond argues for a more empirical understanding of history, giving the example of how evolutionary biologists must take into account the asteroid wiping out the dinosaurs and changing evolutionary history. We can't repeat that event, but we can analyze it and include it in our theorizing. History should have natural explanations in addition to cultural and individual narratives.

He's attempting to answer a question:

"The prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with Yali, a New Guinean politician. The conversation turned to the obvious differences in power and technology between Yali's people and the Europeans who dominated the land for 200 years, differences that neither of them considered due to any genetic superiority of Europeans. Yali asked, using the local term "cargo" for inventions and manufactured goods, "Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?" (p. 14)

Diamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: "People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power." Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, "have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists." (p. 15)

The peoples of other continents (sub-Saharan Africans, Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians and New Guineans, and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous Khoisan peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and Bantu. He believes this is due to these societies' technological and immunological advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last Ice Age."

He notes in the epilogue that he's trying to condense 13,000 years of history of 7 continents in 400 pages, equating to about 150 years of history every page. Necessarily, many topics are compressed, broad, or skipped. Listening to the first part of this book, I'm awed by the detail. It's almost too much! He goes over plant and animal domestication histories.

See the wikipedia page for the full outline of his theory.

New Guinea is a fascinating place. 1,000 of the world's 6,000 languages are spoken in that small region. There are pros and cons to agricultural versus hunter-gatherer (HG) societies. When early humans would meet they would often establish family lines, seeing if they were related to each other in some way. If they didn't, they might attempt to kill each other. Here he discusses how religion and money helped to change relations as those served in place of kinship. HG societies suffer from violence and a lack of sophisticated medical care.

His main argument is about food production. Societies which produce a surplus of food can have members branch out to specialized labor like politics, bureaucracy. He talks about how most HG societies are egalitarian, but there's typically a "big man" or other person who many respect to settle disputes. Some people are good at politics for whatever reason and end up being the ones who distribute a surplus of goods to those who have more need. Eventually this leads to organized states. He criticizes philosophers who discuss states as developing artificially and through force. States historically occur naturally. Additionally, an army with full-time soldiers can overpower smaller groups with multiple responsibilities. 

Pointing to geography, groups are sometimes separated by physical barriers preventing full assimilation into a monolithic society. These separations make for competition. When one group has an innovative technology, that tech is adopted or other groups are out competed. He wants historians to explore further why some societies are resistant to technology. He says not all tech is adopted and maintained over time, many are lost. Japan at one time had the most advanced guns in the world, but the tech fell out locally. Why didn't aborigines adopt bows and arrows when they first came into contact with it?  

In the epilogue he discusses chance occurrences and individual idiosyncrasies changing the course of history. Overall the book is fascinating and gives me a satisfactory account of inequality in the world from geographical, epidemiological, and historical perspectives. This supports my hypothesis that humans are all running a similar, nearly identical algorithm. If we all try to domesticate all useful plants and animals in our vicinity, then the groups which have the most beneficially domesticated plants and animals will have the highest advantage.
