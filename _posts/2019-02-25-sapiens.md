This past month, I finally listened to an audiobook version of [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/) by Professor Yuval Noah Harari that my brother has been recommending to me for quite a while. Sapiens has genuinely changed my life. The first description that comes to mind is _biblical_.

Sapiens begins at the big bang and fast forwards through time to about 2.5 million years ago where it traces homo erectus and the many cousin-species of homo sapiens. What is so impactful to me about this book is how it breaks down the long held hubris of humankind. "They [humans] were insignificant animals, whose ecological impact was less than that of fireflies or jellyfish." With homo sapiens appearing just 0.2 million years ago, we likely held a niche spot in the ecosystem similar to the woodpecker. Just like the woodpecker evolved to eat grubs by hammering through dense bark, we might have evolved to eat bone marrow. When an apex predator such as a tiger killed a giraffe, early humans watched as the tiger and pride ate most of the giraffe. Then the hyenas came to eat the remaining parts. Finally, early humans, after looking all around for predators, slunk towards the carcass to eat any remaining tissue and use stone tools to break bones and eat the marrow. That was our niche.

However, for 2 million years from homo erectus to homo sapiens, our brains just kept growing. We are still unsure as the reason why. With the domestication of fire, humans could scare away beasts, keep themselves warm, cook food, and control their environment. One human could easily burn down a forest in a matter of 20 minutes. How did humans control themselves not to destroy everything? Humans learned to do controlled burning which allowed them to pick through charred meat and other foods in the aftermath of a fire.

Of course, cooking food allowed our bodies to absorb the nutrients better. This hints at what was to come, humans getting more resources from the same amount of food or land when compared to other species.

70,000 years ago began the cognitive revolution which Harari defines as the moment when sapiens began to invade and dominate diverse ecosystems. For the first time in history we know of, a single species with a similar set of DNA successfully adapted itself all across the world. This was not due to slow evolutionary processes but through cognitive abilities.

For much of that time, we lived in tribes, bands of sapiens up to 150, hunting and foraging in up to 1,000 square miles of land. Humans lived and died like this. Their work hours were less than that of farmers, and they likely lead healthier, happier lives. Their diverse diet meant they had almost no nutritional deficiencies. It's difficult to imagine the level of integration human beings had with their environment. All the years we today spend at work or in school were then spent living in their area with their community. Early humans learned seasons, cycles, plants, animals, and the myriad survival skills needed. They had to remember where mushrooms were, where they were growing, and at what time of season. A mistake could mean death or starvation. They likely had dexterity beyond the capabilities of today's most elite athletes.

Aside from the use of fire, sapiens evolved an extremely versatile tool, not language, but myths. Chimpanzees have language. There are calls which mean, "careful - an eagle!" and "careful - a tiger!" When these phrases are recorded and played for other chimps, they scatter and look for cover. This kind of language is immediate and real. Sapiens however can believe in things which are not present or even real.

"Homo sapiens rules the world because it is the only animal that can believe in things that exist purely in its own imagination, such as gods, states, money and human rights," [source](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/).

Neanderthals most likely didn't have the linguistic capabilities sapiens had. They had complex social structures, took care of their young, old, and infirm, and were probably strikingly familiar to us in many ways. They were resistant to the cold in ways we weren't, but we probably couldn't convince them of our religion and myths. The more extraordinary aspect of humans is that we found a way to convince humans beyond our local tribe to work together. Chimps are socially very similar to us, but if you put 1,000 chimps into a smaller area there would be havoc. The chimps would form small bands and likely attack each other in pandemonium. However, sapiens routinely gather in such numbers and many more, acting in coordinated ways.

As sapiens moved into Neanderthals' territory, we began to compete with their food supplies. While getting several dozen members of Neanderthals together to fight could be achieved, sapiens could simply gather more sapiens and outnumber them. Even among sapiens, a well organized army almost always overtakes a disorganized band.

Considering that all sapiens are the same species but often kill each other over minor differences in belief, such as catholics and protestants, hominids that looked human but couldn't interact acceptably must have seemed quite eerie. Similar to the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley), sapiens could have killed or pushed away other hominids for this reason. However, there is evidence for some sapien cross-breeding with neanderthals.

Eventually, sapiens traced no lineage to primates and saw themselves as separate from the animal kingdom. Many sapiens believed there was something divinely special about humans.

The agricultural revolution began only 12,000 years ago.

The Sumerian invention of writing and money 5,000 years ago released societies from the limited data processing of human brains.
