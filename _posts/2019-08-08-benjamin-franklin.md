#### by Benjamin Franklin

The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790.

"The first book to belong permanently to literature. It created a man."
-- From the Introduction

Few men could compare to Benjamin Franklin. Virtually self-taught, he excelled as an athlete, a man of letters, a printer, a scientist, a wit, an inventor, an editor, and a writer, and he was probably the most successful diplomat in American history. David Hume hailed him as the first great philosopher and great man of letters in the New World.

Written initially to guide his son, Franklin's autobiography is a lively, spellbinding account of his unique and eventful life. Stylistically his best work, it has become a classic in world literature, one to inspire and delight readers everywhere.

Chapter 2: He felt ignorant on figures and failed math twice in school, so he read books of arithmetic and navigation books from which he got some geometry. He sharpened his mind with John Locke's _On Human Understanding_ and _[Logic or the Art of Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1207330.Antoine_Arnauld_and_Pierre_Nicole?from_search=true)_.

Chapter 3: He arrived in Philadelphia at the age of 17 with little money and knew no one.

Chapter 4: A long time vegetarian, he broke and ate fish! He talks about how his reasoning shifted in this time of temptation. They cut open a fish's belly to find many smaller fish inside. _If they eat each other, why shouldn't we eat them?_ he thought. He ate hardily for days. After this, he went back to vegetarianism.

Chapter 5: Ben using the socratic method _so hard_ on people, this guy stopped answering simple questions.

Chapter 6: Others drank strong beer hoping to support strong work. Ben drank only water. He tried to convince some others that beer was only as strong as the grain used to make it, and there was more grain in a loaf of bread than any beer.

Chapter 7: Truth and honesty in dealing with people was of foremost importance for a healthy life. This due in part to Ben's reasoning of deism, though he didn't find the beliefs quite useful.

Chapter 8: He wrote a pamphlet promoting paper money, and paper money was set by law. The wealthy didn't like this but didn't have writers to combat the idea. Afterwards, Ben was placed at a money printer which boosted his fortune. He credits his skill in writing.

His only leisure activity for fun was reading. He studied 1-2 hours per day and lived frugally.

He respected all religions in his country, though he found the different sects primarily divisive.

Chapter 9: In search of moral perfection despite natural inclination, custom, and company. He never reached moral perfection but became better because of the pursuit.

Chapter 10: Notes on the brain trust. A small society devoted to advancing each other.

_He who does you a kindness is much more likely to continue to oblige than he whom you would do a kindness for._

The Benjamin Franklin effect: having someone do a favor for you to win their service.

Chapter 11: Witnessing an incredible orator that could preach to 25,000 people.

Chapter 12: He thought inventions should be shared freely. Others patented his works, and he didn't fight them on it because he didn't like litigating this way.

Chapter 13: He notes the accumulation of small advantages is better overall than one large of gift of money. Incremental improvements! He discusses how sweeping the streets gives a small benefit to thousands of citizens.

Chapter 15: Creepy racist remarks by others and a joke by Ben! They were talking about selling their citizens like black people if they become unruly.

Chapter 20: _Paid too much for the whistle!_
When he was 7, he traded a pocketful of coppers for another boy's whistle. He later learned he paid 4 times as much from his family, and they made fun of him until he cried. He took this lesson with him his whole life and was cautious in trades. He would remind himself and see in others that they paid too much for the whistle.

Gosh, I find a kindred spirit in Benjamin Franklin. He really did just seem to keep good habits. He had a deep desire to live on his own on his terms. He was self-reflective and critical about his thoughts and abilities from a young age. He taught himself skills from books and applied those skills to solve problems and do work in his life. He focused on his health, skills, and business, studying or reading 1-2 hours per day for most of his life. He sought friendships of utility, building skills with others and sharing libraries. He focused on writing to improve his prose by hanging around poets. Living as a vegetarian most of his life, he found the lifestyle to be healthy and frugal, saving him money. He did a lot to invest in his communities by creating actual libraries for citizens and academies for higher learning. He juggled multiple projects at the same time. Most inspiring, he wrote his autobiography over a decade and died leaving it unfinished!
