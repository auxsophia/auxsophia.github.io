#### By [Scott Adams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17859574-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big)

Published October 22nd 2013

> **Blasting clichéd career advice, the contrarian pundit and creator of Dilbert recounts the humorous ups and downs of his career, revealing the outsized role of luck in our lives and how best to play the system.**

> Scott Adams has likely failed at more things than anyone you’ve ever met or anyone you’ve even heard of. So how did he go from hapless office worker and serial failure to the creator of Dilbert, one of the world’s most famous syndicated comic strips, in just a few years? In How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Adams shares the game plan he’s followed since he was a teen: invite failure in, embrace it, then pick its pocket.

> No career guide can offer advice that works for everyone. As Adams explains, your best bet is to study the ways of others who made it big and try to glean some tricks and strategies that make sense for you. Adams pulls back the covers on his own unusual life and shares how he turned one failure after another—including his corporate career, his inventions, his investments, and his two restaurants—into something good and lasting. There’s a lot to learn from his personal story, and a lot of entertainment along the way. Adams discovered some unlikely truths that helped to propel him forward. For instance:

> • Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners.

> • “Passion” is bull. What you need is personal energy.

> • A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable.

> • You can manage your odds in a way that makes you look lucky to others.

> Adams hopes you can laugh at his failures while discovering some unique and helpful ideas on your own path to personal victory. As he writes: “This is a story of one person’s unlikely success within the context of scores of embarrassing failures. Was my eventual success primarily a result of talent, luck, hard work, or an accidental just-right balance of each? All I know for sure is that I pursued a conscious strategy of managing my opportunities in a way that would make it easier for luck to find me.”

My summary below comes mainly from chapter 38, his own summary of the book. He notes that out of context these tips can seem very unpersuasive.

Focus on diet first, so you have enough to want to exercise. Exercise will increase your energy which helps all other areas of your life. Once you can manage your personal energy, you need to increase your chances of getting lucky.

Combine skills and overcome embarrassment to narrow the pool of your competitors. Stay in the game a long time to increase your chance of getting lucky.

Happiness is the only useful goal. Acquire key skills through hard work, get your health in order, and gather resources. Work towards a flexible schedule and only take jobs that will set you up for something better. Key skills include public speaking, business writing, basic persuasion, basic tech concepts, social skills, proper voice technique, good grammar, and basic accounting.

Develop a habit of simplifying. Learn how to talk to strangers and avoid being an asshole. If you get it right, and almost anyone can, you will be hard to stop.

Look for patterns for any area of life. Back it up with scientific evidence. Test these patterns on yourself. As per author, lack of fear of embarrassment, education, exercise and looking at success as learnable skill are major patterns for successful people.

Most important, understand that goals are for losers and systems are for winners. People who seem to have good luck tend to have systems that allow luck to find them. Your experience will differ, but it always helps to think in terms of systems instead of goals.

And always remember that failure is your friend. It is the raw material of success, invite it in, learn from it, and don’t let it leave until you pick its pocket. That’s the system.

“Success caused passion more than passion caused success.”

“The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing on just one main metric: my energy. I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the other priorities."

One of the most important tricks for maximizing your productivity involves matching your mental state to the task… At 6: 00 A.M. I’m a creator, and by 2: 00 P.M. I’m a copier… It’s the perfect match of my energy level with a mindless task.”

“Most people aren’t lucky enough to have a flexible schedule. I didn’t have one either for the first sixteen years of my corporate life. So I did the next best thing by going to bed early and getting up at 4: 00 A.M. to do my creative side projects. One of those projects became the sketches for Dilbert.”

“I credit one of my college friends with teaching me the secret of overcoming shyness by imagining you are acting instead of interacting. And by that I mean literally acting. It turns out that a shy person can act like someone else more easily than he can act like himself. That makes some sense because shyness is caused by an internal feeling that you are not worthy to be in the conversation. Acting like someone else gets you out of that way of thinking. When I fake my way past my natural shyness, I like to imagine a specific confident person I know well.”

“Your job as a conversationalist is to keep asking questions and keep looking for something you have in common with the stranger, or something that interests you enough to wade into the topic… The point of conversation is to make the other person feel good.

So how do you get a stranger to like you? It’s simple, actually. It starts by smiling and keeping your body language open. After that, just ask questions and listen as if you cared, all the while looking for common interests. Everyone likes to talk about his or her own life, and everyone appreciates a sympathetic listener. Eventually, if you discover some common interests, you’ll feel a connection without any effort.”

“[Realistically](https://productivityist.com/book-review-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big/), most people have poor filters for sorting truth from fiction, and there’s no objective way to know if you’re particularly good at it or not,” writes Adams. How then do we do it? Adams has six filters for truth. The more filters something can pass through, the more true it probably is.

The Six Filters for Truth are as follows:

Personal experience (Human perceptions are iffy.)
Experience of people you know (Even more unreliable.)
Experts (They work for money, not truth.)
Scientific studies (Correlation is not causation.)
Common sense (A good way to be mistaken with complete confidence.)
Pattern recognition (Patterns, coincidence, and personal bias look alike.)

“I’m a perfect example of the power of leveraging multiple mediocre skills. I’m a rich and famous cartoonist who doesn’t draw well. At social gatherings I’m usually not the funniest person in the room. My writing skills are good, not great. But what I have that most artists and cartoonists do not have is years of corporate business experience plus an MBA from Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.”

“I find it helpful to see the world as a slot machine that doesn’t ask you to put money in. All it asks is your time, focus, and energy to pull the handle over and over. A normal slot machine that requires money will bankrupt any player in the long run. But the machine that has rare yet certain payoffs, and asks for no money up front, is a guaranteed winner if you have what it takes to keep yanking until you get lucky. In that environment, you can fail 99 percent of the time, while knowing success is guaranteed. All you need to do is stay in the game long enough.”

[His formula for priorities is also very simple and easy to follow](https://medium.com/@PetriB/book-summary-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big-scott-adams-e56c9f1be6cb).

Look after yourself first. This involves eating right, exercising, avoiding unnecessary stress and getting enough sleep.
Look after your economics. That includes your job, your investments, and even your house.
Look after all the other things. Your family, community, country and the world.
His reason for this “selfish” approach is that when you aren’t looking after yourself and your economics you become a burden on your family, friends and community. So first look after yourself before you try and look after anyone else.

“If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it. It sounds trivial and obvious, but if you unpack the idea it has extraordinary power.”

“Successful people don’t wish for success; they decide to pursue it. And to pursue it effectively, they need a system. Success always has a price, but the reality is that the price is negotiable. If you pick the right system, the price will be a lot nearer to what you’re willing to pay.”

“I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the other priorities. Maximizing my personal energy means eating right, exercising, avoiding unnecessary stress, getting enough sleep, and all of the obvious steps. But it also means having something in my life that makes me excited to wake up.”

“Exercise, food, and sleep should be your first buttons to push if you’re trying to elevate your attitude and raise your energy.”

“A great strategy for success in life is to become good at something, anything, and let that feeling propel you to new and better victories. Success can be habit-forming.“

“The Success Formula: Every Skill You Acquire Doubles Your Odds of Success”

“If you think extraordinary talent and a maniacal pursuit of excellence are necessary for success, I say that’s just one approach, and probably the hardest. When it comes to skills, quantity often beats quality.”

“Good + Good > Excellent”

“It’s hard to become rich enough to buy your own private island but, relatively speaking, it’s easier to find a job with flexible hours. A person with a flexible schedule and average resources will be happier than a rich person who has everything except a flexible schedule. Step one in your search for happiness is to continually work toward having control of your schedule.”
