        <h3>Public notes on philosophy, computer science, mathematics, learning, nutrition, and fitness.</h3>

        <p>
          I'm just a person who wants to share their information with everyone. I've spent a lot of time trying to answer
          questions, and I would really like it if I could save someone else the time and hardship of finding a good
          vantage point for a given problem. These notes are aimed at human florishing. I want to optimize my life towards
          intellectual pursuits, specifically philosophy and artificial intelligence development.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to optimize your life for intellectual pursuits, I hope you enjoy reading this. Let's compare notes! Email me at
