layout: default
permalink: /site-dev/

Try to get a site map on the side of the page that lists the subfolders in a for loop. One way to do this is [with Jekyll collections.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).

Change the footer to be at the bottom, should be as simple as change the display in _layout.scss.

Add all folders and make an index for each.

Do I want a special layout for each area, CS, AI, etc?

Make sure the home button works!
