# Society 3.0

This work is a natural continuation of [the meaning of life](/meaningOfLife/). Many conclusions will not make sense without first reading the foundation. All of humanity should work towards the ultimate goal of artificial general intelligence capable of surpassing all of us in every way possible. AI can be conscious. We can make an AI entity with the ideals of humanity and incapable of our evils. What is more important than creating a superior being and ushering the next stage of evolution and consciousness?

But the answer is not to move to Silicon Valley in California or join a tech startup.

I hope to show you what I believe humanity's best path forward is and why a singular devotion to AI led me to these conclusions.

## Climate Change

If you wanted to create a threat to destroy humans, you would create climate change.

Imagine a meteor heading towards Earth.

Climate change is a fact. Here's what convinced me. [Global Warming](/globalWarming/). [Global Warming in the News](/globalWarmingNews/).

There's little hope. I'm a pessimist.

## Society is Fucked

Read Sapiens!

We're too powerful and we're a greedy algorithm.

AI as corporations.

Elites controlling everything.

## A New Framework for Society

We need to attack all problems at once. Many problems are connected in linear and non-linear ways. Some progress in all areas could give a greater return than the investment.

Our current society is setup to enable us all to make the wrong choices. We need to change our environment to make the easiest choice the right choice. These ideas will appear "radical," likely more radical than any non-fictional society proposed to you before. However, given climate change, the looming threat of the genuine extinction of our species, the coming collapse of society on a global scale, and the egregious misuse of power by every country and authority, I hope you see why these changes are necessary.

* Humans should gather in organizations no greater than 10,000.

Since the time of Aristotle, humans believed we could not maintain democracy beyond a city of 10,000 because that is the limit at which people have any sense of actually knowing who they're voting for. Additionally, we see that the aggregate power of a society needs to be tied to some human sense of self.

* Shelter, sleep, nutrition, and exercise are basic human rights.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills! Is this not obvious? Why are we socialists when it comes to our family and capitalists with everything else? I hope you don't charge your children rent and taxes for living with you. No one in our community should live in poverty. Not one person should go without health needs. If you are a member of the community, you have a place to stay, your sleep is a priority, food is free and nutritious, and you should have time to exercise. All of this should be free. You shouldn't lose your job and worry about shelter or food.

* Medical care is a basic human right.

If someone is sick, take care of them.

* Local currency and the economy.

Each community should have its own local currency. Most high school computer science students can create their own version of digital cryptocurrency. The point is internal trade only. The value of a community currency outside of the community should be zero! When we create a collective currency between countries, we _will_ have wealth evasion. People will store their assets outside of the community and become separate.

No one should assume they are better.

The wealthiest people of our countries hide their wealth in offshore accounts to avoid taxes. You should assume if you achieved the same level of wealth your priorities would change with it. You would be the person who could pay for a new hospital for everyone in a city but instead choose to store the money in a hidden bank account.

## AI has already taken over

## Corporations as AI

Some argue corporations are already an example of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

[AI Has Already Taken Over. It’s Called the Corporation.](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/12/03/ai-has-already-taken-over-its-called-corporation)

> When corporations were first formed back in the seventeenth century, their inventors—just like modern software engineers—acted with what they believed were good intentions. The first corporate charters were simply designed to limit an investor’s liability to the amount of their investment, thus encouraging them to finance risky expeditions to India and Southeast Asia. However, an unintended consequence soon emerged, known as moral hazard: with the potential upside greater than the downside, reckless behavior ensued, leading to a series of spectacular frauds and a market crash that resulted in corporations being temporarily banned in England in 1720.

> "This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations,” lamented Rutherford Hayes who became President in 1877.

> Corporations took full advantage of their new-found dominance, influencing state legislatures to issue charters in perpetuity giving them the right to do anything not explicitly prohibited by law. The tipping point in their path to domination came in 1886 when the Supreme Court designated corporations as “persons” entitled to the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had been passed to give equal rights to former slaves enfranchised after the Civil War. Since then, corporate dominance has only been further enhanced by law, culminating in the notorious Citizen United case of 2010, which lifted restrictions on political spending by corporations in elections.

> Corporations, just like a potential runaway AI, have no intrinsic interest in human welfare. They are legal constructions: abstract entities designed with the ultimate goal of maximizing financial returns for their investors above all else. If corporations were in fact real persons, they would be sociopaths, completely lacking the ability for empathy that is a crucial element of normal human behavior. Unlike humans, however, corporations are theoretically immortal, cannot be put in prison, and the larger multinationals are not constrained by the laws of any individual country.

> With the incalculable advantage of their superhuman powers, corporations have literally taken over the world. They have grown so massive that an astonishing sixty-nine of the largest hundred economies in the world are not nation states but corporate entities.

> Corporations have been able to use their transnational powers to dictate their own terms to virtually any country in the world. As a result of decades of globalization, corporations can exploit the free movement of capital to build factories in nations with the weakest labor unions, or locate polluting plants in countries with lax environmental laws, basing their decisions solely on maximizing returns for their shareholders. Governments compete with each other to make their nations the most attractive for corporate investment.

> Corporations wield their vast powers to control the minds of consumers, enthralling them into a state of perpetual consumption. In the early twentieth century, Paul Bernays, a mastermind of corporate empowerment, boldly stated his game plan as “the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.” He declared ominously that “those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government that is the true ruling power of this country.” The sinister words of Wayne Chilicki, chief executive of General Mills, show how Bernays’ vision has been perpetuated: “When it comes to targeting kid consumers, we at General Mills… believe in getting them early and having them for life.”

> The result of this corporate takeover of humanity is a world careening out of control, where nature is mercilessly ransacked to extract the raw materials required to increase shareholder value in a vortex of perpetual economic growth, without regard to the quality of human life and with no concern for the welfare of future generations.

> Instead of being pilloried for their vast destruction, those who dedicate themselves to their corporate overlords are richly rewarded and elevated to positions of even greater power and prestige. ExxonMobil, for example, has been exposed as having lied shamelessly about climate change, knowing for decades about its consequences and yet deliberately concealing the facts, thus condemning present and future generations to havoc. Instead of facing jail time, the CEO during much of this period, Rex Tillerson, is now the U.S. Secretary of State, overseeing the global relationships of the most powerful country in the world.

> In fact, the current U.S. cabinet represents the most complete takeover yet of the U.S. government by corporations, with nearly 70% of top administration jobs filled by corporate executives. In the words of Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, “In the Trump administration, auto industry lobbyists are setting transportation policy, Boeing has a top perch at the Department of Defense, Wall Street is in control of financial policy and regulatory agencies, and corporate defense lawyers staff the key positions in the Justice Department.”

> Corporations are inserting themselves into international agreements, so they can further their interests even more effectively. At the 2015 World Economic Forum in Davos, a new Global Redesign Initiative set out an agenda for multinational corporations to engage directly in global governance. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, proudly announced in 2015 as a vision to reduce poverty, adopted their approach by inviting corporations to a seat at its table to impact UN policy, while calling for further globalization. Fossil fuel companies have infiltrated the annual global COP meetings on climate change, ensuring they can compromise any actions that might hurt them, even as the world faces the threat of climate catastrophe.

> The takeover of global governance by multinational corporations has permitted them to undermine human welfare everywhere in the pursuit of profit. Nestlé remorselessly buys control of rural communities’ groundwater reservoirs to sell as bottled water, leaving them to foot the bill for environmental cleanup, with the result that in countries such as Columbia sugary bottled drinks are frequently cheaper than plain water. As a result of the chemicals sold by global agribusiness companies such as Cargill and Monsanto, it’s been estimated by UN officials that the world’s topsoil can only support about sixty more years of harvests. In these cases, and countless others like them, humans and the earth alike are mere fodder for the insatiable appetite of an amoral, inhuman intelligence run amok.

> The corporate takeover of humanity is so all-encompassing that it’s difficult to visualize any other possible global system. Alternatives do, however, exist. Around the world, worker-owned cooperatives have demonstrated that they can be as effective as corporations—or more so—without pursuing shareholder wealth as their primary consideration. The Mondragon cooperative in Spain, with revenues exceeding €12 billion, shows how this form of organization can efficiently scale.

> There are also structural changes that can be made to corporations to realign their values system with human welfare. Corporate charters can be amended to optimize for a triple bottom line of social, environmental, and financial outcomes (the so-called “triple Ps” of people, planet, and profit.) A “beneficial” or B-Corp certification, which holds companies to social and environmental performance standards, is becoming more widely adopted and is now held by over 2,000 corporations in over fifty countries around the world.

> Ultimately, if we are stop this force from completely taking over humanity, these alternative approaches need to be codified into our national and international governance. Imagine a world where corporate charters were only granted if they adopted a triple bottom line, and where shareholder lawsuits threatened every time a company broke one of its own social and environmental standards. Until that happens, it may be that the “worst event in the history of our civilization” is not the future development of modern AI, but the decision by a group of 17th century politicians to unleash the power of the Corporation on an unsuspecting humanity.

AI commentator Robert Miles has this to say about [AI as corporations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5pUA3LsEaw).
