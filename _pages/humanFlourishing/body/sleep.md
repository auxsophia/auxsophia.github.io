# Sleep: The Foundation of Health

Sleep bothered me as a kid. I hated feeling tired, but sleep felt like a waste of time. Why do we sleep at all? Even in the wild animals could easily be eaten while asleep. We could do more with 8 extra hours in our day. The feeling of waste didn't leave me for many years. I read about [lucid dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) and learned tips on how to practice.  

### "_A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming. During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters, narrative, and environment; however, this is not actually necessary for a dream to be described as lucid,_" -- Wikipedia

I met a person who claimed to have lucid dreams. Oddly enough, he was in an online atheist group debating believers. He said he got to the point of control where he did his taxes in his sleep. He woke up and filled out the forms. He said he practiced to gain control but always had vivid dreams. I would believe him less if he continued with how much time he saved in his life everyday, but he ended his story by saying he gave up on lucid dreaming. He felt the ability to control dreams was unnatural; we shouldn't mess with normal sleep. Some of the resources I read also backed this if a person is looking to control their dreams to avoid a persistent intrusive dream or nightmare. Repetitive dreams are often a sign of a psychological/neurological problem that should be treated as a health issue.

I was intoxicated by the idea of controlling my dreams to practice physical or intellectual skills, making sleep more directed. What if I could study for a test the next day for four hours while I slept? Plus I could web-sling like Spider-man or generally be a superhero. The episode of _Batman: The Animated Series_ is still with me where Batman is stuck asleep and has to gain control by recognizing he's asleep and breaking the current dream. A friend's dad said he could lucid dream after recognizing the dream and smashing a clock. I read and asked around on how to lucid dream myself.

## The Basic Method:

1. Start remembering your dreams.
2. Look for patterns, repeating events in dreams.
3. At various times throughout the day, reality test if you are in a dream to gain the habit and repeat the test in your sleep.
4. Once the habit seeps into your dreaming state, you will gain control of the dream.

I kept a dream journal at different times of my life in different formats, keeping notes in text on my phone, in an app paid and unpaid, and in voice messages. I had notification reminders several times per day to remind me to reality check and test if I'm dreaming. If you can detect a pattern in your dreams, like you often see clocks but can't quite make out the actual time, then make the reminder in real life that whenever you see a clock you ask yourself if you're dreaming. At night I would focus with intent on remembering my dreams in the morning. I pictured my morning self laying in bed reflecting on my dreams. In the morning, I laid still for a few minutes without moving. If you move, you end up forgetting your dreams faster. Even when I didn't remember, I searched for a trace sometimes catching the faint imprints of intense moments in a disconnected dream. Sometimes the dreams would shoot into my brain later in the day.

The more I practiced the better I remembered. I did end up lucid dreaming several times in my life, but often not when I tried with any effort. For a few times I had incredible lucid dreaming. However, I never reached a stage where I could regularly lucid dream at will. While I did reality test in my dreams to see if I was dreaming, similar to waking, I believed I was awake in my dream and only realized my error when I woke up, leaving me with unsettling philosophical implications for waking life. Looking back my vivid dreams often centered around consumption of healthier foods rich in magnesium and B-vitamins closer to bedtime and drank plenty of water throughout the day. Vivid dreams are often a sign of healthy sleep.

## I gave up on lucid dreaming, but by tracking my dreams and bringing greater awareness I began to appreciate dreaming (and sleeping).

Dreams are an altered state, a connection to our unconscious. They're simply interesting. I looked at dreams like a natural psychedelic drug without any risks and only benefits. Instead of focusing on controlling my dreams, I focused on _optimizing my sleep_. I [learned more about the science of sleep](/learning/). [REM sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep) is talked about in introductory psychology books; it's the phase of sleep we have the most vivid dreams and is common to mammals. We need REM sleep.

Some of the greatest inventors of history are rumored to have hacked sleep to optimum. They were able to create multiple incredible inventions while only sleeping in several small naps throughout the day. By slipping right into a 20 minute nap six times per day, about once every 4 hours, they would get 2 hours of REM sleep total in a day. Most full night sleepers only get 1.5 hours of REM sleep on average! Could the extra REM sleep be the super-charging factor in their creative genius? Experimenters say if you can fight through the initial adjustment phase and train your body to get REM immediately, you will no longer need a long block of sleep. Some labeled this the Uberman sleeping schedule. I found a small literature on [poly-phasic sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep). I [detail my experiments with sleep in another article](/polyphasic-sleep/). The conclusion I found from my experiment after suffering un-adjustable sleep deprivation was there are most likely two optimal sleeping schedules for humans to maximize creativity, recuperation, and function:

1. A solid block of uninterrupted sleep at night
2. A [siesta style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta) sleeping pattern with naps in the afternoon

I learned a lot about napping! Naps should be at least 20 minutes for a short, full, deep sleep cycle. If you snooze in the morning for only 10 or 15 minutes and repeat that, you're hurting your sleep hygiene and your day. The process for your body to clear hormones signaling sleep and wakefulness is disrupted. Most people feel groggy throughout the day. If you do snooze, the more optimal time is about 20 minutes, I give 21 minutes. This also helps me snooze a little less since I know I won't wake up before the alarm again and need the time.

### _Naps are best taken in the afternoon after a meal._

A nap should be a max of about one and a half hours. Any more than that disrupts your [circadian rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm).

> "A circadian rhythm is a natural, internal process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle and repeats roughly every 24 hours," -- Wikipedia

If your circadian rhythm is disrupted, you will have trouble falling asleep at a natural time. If I wake up around 7-8am, I wake up from my last nap by 5pm so I don't accidentally trick my body into thinking I'm sleeping for the night. In general when you're groggy either your circadian rhythm is disrupted or you have accrued sleep debt, you're not sleeping enough!

### Sleep has two functions
1. To repeat neural patterns of activities you are learning (generating dreams)
2. To wash away metabolic waste built up throughout the day

Thinking is one of the most energy intense activities we can do. Like a muscle, waste products build up from thinking. This is a major part of the reason why losing sleep for anyone is dangerous. Driving tired is like driving drunk!

> "Drowsy driving is dangerous because sleep deprivation can have similar effects on your body as drinking alcohol. Being awake for 18 hours straight makes you drive like you have a blood alcohol level of .05 (for reference, .08 is considered drunk). If you’ve been awake for a full 24 hours and drive—say, after a night where you just couldn’t fall asleep—it’s like you have a blood alcohol level of .10." -- [SleepFoundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/drowsy-driving-vs-drunk-driving-how-similar-are-they)

Chronic sleep debt has many accumulating negative effects. During the body's sleep cycles, hormones are secreted and replenished. Even sleep itself can be thrown off as melatonin is the hormone signaling to sleep and wake up. Many people supplement melatonin in their diet for sleep, but I'm hesitant to get my body used to a strong outside source.

> "When eyes receive light from the sun, the pineal gland's production of melatonin is inhibited and the hormones produced keep the human awake. When the eyes do not receive light, melatonin is produced in the pineal gland and the human becomes tired." -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm#Biological_markers_and_effects)

[We've found the spectrum of light from the sun which inhibits the pineal gland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm#Light_and_the_biological_clock), the blue light spectrum. However, red light doesn't effect night vision. You can stay in red lit rooms and go straight into a dark night with no adjustment. Consider switching out some of your light bulbs for red shifted bulbs. 3 hours before bedtime you can use these lights and do some light reading. Similarly, when you wake up and get several minutes of sunshine your body shifts into wakefulness phases easier.

## Sleep is the foundation of health because our hormones impact our diet choices and energy levels for exercise.

[Ghrelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin) and [leptin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin) regulate hunger which can be thrown off by a disrupted sleep schedule. People tend to go for high carb and sugar diets when lacking sleep. If you're having trouble sticking to a [healthy diet](/nutrition/) it could be due to missing sleep and the resulting hormonal imbalance sabotaging you.

When you're tired and low energy from bad food choices, it's tough for anyone to find motivation to [exercise](/calisthenics/), but exercise is an investment everyone should be doing.

## The first question I ask about a person's health is how their sleep is.

How much sleep you should get depends on a number of factors. I think everyone should get at least 8 hours, everyone. [Here are recommendations by age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Recommendations).

I know my best day's are after a quality night of rest. I hope you see sleep as a priority and area for ongoing self-improvement. Here's a growing list of my tips.

### Sleep tips:

* Try to wake up and go to sleep at the same time everyday (I'm still working on this!)
* Make your bedroom as dark as possible
* For three hours before bed
  * Avoid activities too stimulating
  * Avoid blue light, stick to warm colors and consider blue light blocking glasses and night-shifting your screens
* Eat foods rich in B-vitamins, magnesium, calcium, and iron which will nourish your brain and calm tense muscles
* [Practicing meditation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6_3mnHSoqCWN_NKvgf7zxemNQccssUDA) can help you fall asleep by letting go of anxious thoughts
* Avoid caffeine, a stimulant, 10-12 hours before sleep (for most people it takes that long for their body to break down caffeine) - _I try to cut caffeine after 12pm._
* Get into a bedtime routine habit
* Change your mindset to see **falling asleep is a skill you can get better at with practice**
* Get a little colder if you can (2-3 degrees Fahrenheit lower) to initiate sleep
* Use your bed for sleeping only (and sex)

### A Basic Method to Fall Asleep

* Laying in bed, relax your body from head to toe, turning your attention to each body part, your head, your face, your neck. Relax each muscle in a wave down your body. Spreading to your arms down to your finger tips, then returning to your torso down to your toes, stopping especially on the thighs for an extra moment to relax the quads and hamstrings. Pause at any body part that feels tense.

* Check in with your breathing. Note any tension or tightness in your breath. There are many different breathing techniques to calm and center the mind. Try the [_box breathing technique_](https://neurohacker.com/breathing-technique-focus-mind).

---

**The Basics**:
* On the inhale, expand the belly, then the diaphragm, then the upper chest. On the exhale, let the breath go first from the upper chest, then the ribcage, then the belly. This helps you relearn how to breathe deeply.
* Inhale and exhale solely through the nose. It stimulates the nerves that activate the parasympathetic nervous system and counters the fear response of the sympathetic nervous system.

**Steps**:
* Inhale for a count of 5.
* Retain and hold the breath for a count of 5.
* Exhale all the breath from the lungs for a count of 5.
* Retain and hold the breath for a count of 5.
* Repeat.

**Length**: Start with 1-3 minute “spot drills” several times a day before an important meeting or event. Work up to 5-10 minutes a day.

### Other Resources

I really liked this guide by the Art of Manliness on [How to Fall Asleep in 2 Minutes or Less](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/fall-asleep-fast/).

> "Yet the ability to fall asleep in two minutes or less, anywhere, anytime, is actually a skill like any other, and one anyone can learn. The technique for how to do so was in fact developed for Naval aviators during World War II, and today we’ll share it with you."

> "A couple years into WWII, the U.S. military realized it had a problem on its hands. Due to the enormous pressures of aerial combat, many of its pilots were accumulating levels of stress so debilitating that they were cracking under it. The tension caused them to lock up in flight and make fatal mistakes — accidentally shooting down friendly planes, or becoming an avoidable casualty themselves."

The two goals for this method are physical and mental relaxation:

---

“Sit back in your chairs and put your feet flat on the deck. Knees apart, your hands limp on the inside of your lap. Now, close your eyes and drop your chin until it rests on your chest.

Let’s breathe slowly, deeply, and regularly. Take all the wrinkles out of your forehead. Relax your scalp. Just let go. Now let your jaw sag-g-g. Let it drop open. Now relax the rest of your face muscles. Get the brook trout look on your face. Even relax your tongue and lips. Just let them go loose. Breathe slowly.

Now, let’s go after the eight muscles that control your eyes. Let them go limp in their sockets. No focus, just let them go limp. Breathe slowly.

Now drop your shoulders as low as they will go. You think that they are low, but let them go more.  Did you feel the muscles in the back of your neck go limp? When you think you are really relaxed, let them go even more.

Now, let’s relax your chest. Take a deep breath. Hold it. Exhale and blow out all your tensions. Just let your chest collapse. Let it sag-g-g. Imagine you are a big, heavy blob on the chair, a jellyfish. Breathe slowly. When you exhale, release more and more of your tensions.

Let’s go after your arms. Talk directly to your arm muscles. First, talk to your right bicep. Tell it to relax, go limp. Do the same to your right forearm. Now to the right hand and fingers. Your arm should feel like a dead weight on your leg. Repeat the relaxation process with your left arm. Breathe slowly.

Your entire upper body has been exposed to relaxation and a warm, pleasant feeling comes over you. You feel good. A sense of well-being invades your body.

Now for your lower body. Talk to your right thigh muscles. Let them go to a dead weight on the chair. Let the meat hang on the bones. Go through the same routine for the right calf muscles. Then all the muscles of your right ankle and foot. Tell yourself that your right leg has no bones in it. It is just a flabby, heavy weight on the deck. Repeat the process with your left thigh, calf, ankle, and foot.

At present you are all relaxed physically, or think you are. For a little insurance, let’s take three deep breaths and when you let them out, blow out all the remaining tensions, one . . . whoosh, two . . . whoosh, three . . . whoosh.”

---

After you are physically relaxed, calm the mind with one of these visualizations. The key is to not imagine your body physically moving.

---

“First, we want you to fantasize that it is a warm spring day and you are lying in the bottom of a canoe on a very serene lake. You are looking up at a blue sky with lazy, floating clouds. Do not allow any other thought to creep in. Just concentrate on this picture and keep foreign thoughts out, particularly thoughts with any movement or motion involved. Hold this picture and enjoy it for ten seconds.

In the second sleep-producing fantasy, imagine that you are in a big, black, velvet hammock and everywhere you look is black. You must also hold this picture for ten seconds.

The third trick is to say the words ‘don’t think . . . don’t think . . . don’t think,’ etc. Hold this, blanking out other thoughts for at least ten seconds.”

---

> "The cadets at the pre-flight school had been broken into two groups: one which took the relaxation course, and the other a control group. The former outperformed the latter in every mentally-taxing class, discipline-requiring drill, and physically-intensive test. And after six weeks of practice, 96% of the aviators were able to fall asleep in 2 minutes or less — anywhere and anytime. Not only that, they could do it even when they drank coffee (though having caffeine in your system does make it harder), and even while the simulated noise of gunfire and cannon blasts played in the background!"

> "Keep in mind that being able to relax physically and mentally, and thus being able to fall asleep at the drop of a hat, is a skill, and like all skills, you shouldn’t expect to get the hang of it and have it work the first few times you try. You have to practice over and over again, until you get better and better at loosening up and calming down. That doesn’t mean you should work _hard_ at trying to relax; that will just backfire and create tension. But you do have to practice this routine _consistently_."

P.S.
