Considering compound interest, we can invest in our health based on what area we do most often. I recommend investing in:

- [Posture](/posture/)
- Breathing
- [Sleep](/sleep/)
- [Nutrition](/nutrition/)
- [Exercise](/calisthenics/)

Unless you are collapsed, you hold a posture. Secondly you breathe. Sleep effects so much! Then nutrition can impact everything, but we aren't eating all the time. However think about the quality of your water! We should be drinking a lot of water. Exercise is an energy and health investment that pays back quickly.

Proper [hygiene](/hygiene/) is also important.
