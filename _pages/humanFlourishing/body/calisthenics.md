### Resources

I got my start with the [bodyweight fitness subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/). I did the [recommended routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine#wiki_welcome_to_the_recommended_routine) for a few years. Of course, during school I wasn't able to be very consistent, sometimes training only once or twice per week, taking off a month or two before getting back into it. Slowly I made progress as my body grew to meet new physical demands. Just getting your tendons to adjust can take 6 months. They update the routine regularly. Check out the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq).

With a little searching, you're likely to come across [Steven Low's _Overcoming Gravity_](https://stevenlow.org/overcoming-gravity/).

"Commonly referred to by readers as an “exercise Bible,” Overcoming Gravity is a comprehensive guide that provides a gold mine of information for gymnastics and bodyweight strength training within its nearly 600 pages."

Definitely a great resource with progressions, detailed descriptions, sample programs, injury prevention, and more.

Here's a [progression chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tjAcd0u7pTTTdSlke5_8rGCo7afuR3xh23HnrVqwfNI/edit#gid=0) on Google Sheets from the book.

### [How To Progress In Calisthenics Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNv2-zc8ZY)

One of the main criticisms of calisthenics is that it's difficult to make the exercises more or less challenging. With weightlifting you can increase or decrease weights.

* Negative reps (eccentric training)
  * "An eccentric contraction is the motion of an active muscle while it is lengthening under load." [Wikipedia - Eccentric training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_training)
  * Get ready for sore muscles (may need more recovery time)
  * Pair this with an easier progression of the exercise
* Progressions
  * "Calisthenics is all about changing and adapting the exercises to your current level of performance."
  * Change your lever, tuck, and angle
  * If you can't hold a movement for more than a few seconds, try an easier progression
* Unilateral training (archer)
  * Archer movements bend one limb and leave the other straight
  * Training one side greatly increases the load
* Workout tools
  * Weighted vests and clothes
  * Assistive resistance bands
    * Downside is they don't have the same support through the full range of motion
    * Can combine bands with unilateral training
