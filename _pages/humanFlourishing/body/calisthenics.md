### [How To Progress In Calisthenics Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNv2-zc8ZY)

One of the main criticisms of calisthenics is that it's difficult to make the exercises more or less challenging. With weightlifting you can increase or decrease weights.

* Negative reps (eccentric training)
  * "An eccentric contraction is the motion of an active muscle while it is lengthening under load." [Wikipedia - Eccentric training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_training)
  * Get ready for sore muscles (may need more recovery time)
  * Pair this with an easier progression of the exercise
* Progressions
  * "Calisthenics is all about changing and adapting the exercises to your current level of performance."
  * Change your lever, tuck, and angle
  * If you can't hold a movement for more than a few seconds, try an easier progression
* Unilateral training (archer)
  * Archer movements bend one limb and leave the other straight
  * Training one side greatly increases the load
* Workout tools
  * Weighted vests and clothes
  * Assistive resistance bands
    * Downside is they don't have the same support through the full range of motion
    * Can combine bands with unilateral training
