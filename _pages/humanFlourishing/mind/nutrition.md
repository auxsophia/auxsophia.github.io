Aside from the [MIND diet](./MINDdiet/), there is the [flexitarian diet](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46865204) which aims for sustainability. "A diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet."

## Who came up with this?
A group of 37 scientists from around the world were brought together as part of the [EAT-Lancet commission](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/).

They're a mix of experts from farming to climate change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their findings which have been published in the Lancet.

## Why do we need a diet for 10 billion people?
The world population reached seven billion in 2011 and it's now around 7.7 billion. That figure is expected to reach 10 billion around 2050 and will keep on climbing.

## Will it save lives?
The researchers say the diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year.

That number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are now the biggest killers in developed countries.
