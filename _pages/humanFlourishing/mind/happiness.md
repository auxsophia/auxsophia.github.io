##[Your Brain Is Wired to Suck the Joy Out of Good News](https://medium.com/s/thenewnew/your-brain-is-wired-to-suck-the-joy-out-of-good-news-f8b06aba1db8)
>Researchers believe hedonic adaptation is a protective mechanism, preventing external stimuli from having too great an impact on our internal state — kind of like the happiness equivalent of sweating to keep cool. Some have even called it a “psychological immune system,” since adaptation is how we bounce back from whatever life throws at us. But it’s often detrimental instead, sometimes to the point of making us question the choices we’ve made in the pursuit of happiness: Maybe I married the wrong person. Perhaps this isn’t the right career for me. I’ll try a different flavor next time.

>Research suggests that it’s possible — at least, up to a point. In 2005, psychologists Ken Sheldon, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and David Schkade authored a [paper](http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/wp-content/themes/sonjalyubomirsky/papers/LSS2005.pdf#page=6) breaking down the factors that influence our happiness. Around 50 percent is based on fixed traits like personality and genetics, they wrote, while another 10 percent is influenced by circumstances, leaving 40 percent within our control, malleable with what the authors called “intentional activity.”

>Together with Lyubomirsky, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside, Sheldon developed the hedonic adaptation prevention (HAP) model, a strategy for slowing down the deterioration of happiness that follows the boost from exciting life events. The key to holding on to happiness, he says, is twofold: appreciation and variety.

>Appreciation — which the pair described in a 2012 [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167212436400?journalCode=pspc) as “the psychological opposite of adaptation” — means “intentionally savoring the state of affairs, or intentionally cultivating gratitude,” explains Sheldon, a psychology professor at the University of Missouri. By paying more deliberate attention to the root causes of your happiness in a given moment, you give that happiness more staying power.

>In another way, variety might also be considered the opposite of adaptation. By having “many memorable, positive events day to day,” Sheldon says, you can prevent your brain from getting too used to any single one too quickly.

>But cultivating happiness isn’t a one-size-fits-all affair. If appreciation and variety don’t work for you, Jordi Quoidbach, a psychology professor at the University Pompeu Fabra in Spain has identified another strategy in his research: occasional [abstinence](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550612473489?journalCode=sppa) from something that makes you happy. Too much of a good thing, Quoidbach has found, can have a dulling effect. If you keep chocolate on hand all the time, it doesn’t really feel like a treat anymore. If you and your spouse both work from home, you may see too much of each other and never have that “excited to see you again” feeling. One of Quoidbach’s [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25583943) found that just feeling well-traveled, regardless of actual experience, can make people less interested in spending time at a given tourist destination. Spacing out your pleasures can make each one that much more potent.
