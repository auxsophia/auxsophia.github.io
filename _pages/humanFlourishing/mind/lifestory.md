# My Life Story in 5 Minutes

We should actively take hold of our [narrative self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity) and construct a narrative we desire.

> "The theory of narrative identity postulates that individuals form an identity by integrating their life experiences into an internalized, evolving story of the self that provides the individual with a sense of unity and purpose in life. This life narrative integrates one's reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future. Furthermore, this narrative is a story â€“ it has characters, episodes, imagery, a setting, plots, and themes and often follows the traditional model of a story, having a beginning (initiating event), middle (an attempt and a consequence), and an end (denouement)." -- Wikipedia

5 minutes total seems like a good time limit to me. Of course this won't capture everything, but that is part of the point. Only the most potent words should be used to express your life. By condensing your narrative you identify the driving forces of your life and overarching themes.

[According to one source](https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/06/02/101702_how-fast-average-person-speaks.html) the average person speaks at a rate of 100-130 words per minute (about 4-5 syllables per second). As a rough goal, I will aim for 120 words per minute, 600 words total.

And after writing the above, I found 5 minutes somehow too small and not nearly enough! I'll condense as much I can.

Ages 0-10:
I was born 1991 three years after my older brother. Our parents met in a halfway house for the mentally ill, so they could reintegrate into society. Both of my parents had severe mental illnesses, diseased brains. My father had paranoid schizophrenia and took medication most of my life. I don't know if my mother ever had an accurate diagnosis, but my guess is at least schizoaffective disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She stopped taking medication when I was two or three. During her psychotic break she would scream at my father for hours until the police were called. Cops broke down our door, dragged my mom out in front of our apartment and the neighborhood of people, twisted her arm, and pepper-sprayed her. They took me at age 3 and my brother, 6, to government care. Within months the state gave us back to our parents. A kind neighbor realized we couldn't live in that city anymore and drove us from Bakersfield, California to Las Vegas. At the age of 5, while my mother was at work my father had a psychotic break and was so confused about reality he jumped through one of our windows. He was so panicked he didn't think to use a door or open the window. Using his arms to block, he rammed through the window pane to the other side. The police came again to separate me and my brother from our parents to child haven. While I have few memories of the first separation I remember the second better. I learned how to tie my shoes from a childcare worker. I caught a chicken pox virus bad on my skin and was given antibiotics. My parents were court ordered to take a parenting class and got us back again.

Since then we moved apartments on average every three months to hide from child protective services, save money, and ease my mother's fears. My mom had months of severe mania. She would hardly sleep at all and would sometimes yell incoherent sentences all day and into the night. I remember my father most sitting at whatever kitchen table we had, drinking coffee, endlessly smoking. There are few creatures more stoic than a medicated human being. My childhood was a horror I would not wish on my greatest enemy. _Nothing was safe; nothing was sacred._ No child should live in chaos facing mental, physical, and emotional abuse. By age 6 the stress and dysfunction made me obese. Being labeled "fat" and moving as an overweight kid with fluctuating weight based on my feast or famine diet of American fast food was a torture of its own. My main escape was fantasizing. Constantly daydreaming, I thought of imaginary worlds, other places, whatever didn't involve me. Sometimes I inserted myself as a character where I had greater power and influence. The real world was out of control. Even at a young age I knew the situation we were in didn't feel right. I talked to my brother about returning to child haven, government care. I talked it over with my brother, but he thought child haven was a bad place where kids weren't doing well. He wanted us to stay. Through these bad times I considered my options over and over. If I called for help I would be dooming my brother to be taken with me. They wouldn't take just one of us if we had unfit parents. I would probably never see my dad again, and the idea hurt. There was a chance me and my brother would be separated to different homes. If the state really saw what we lived through, maybe my parents would go to prison. My choices effected our whole family. I could change the course of our lives, but what if I was wrong? I was the youngest, the least experienced. I couldn't be sure, and no one agreed with me. Besides...if it was really bad, _someone_ would stop this, wouldn't they? Everything became a test of endurance. How much would I take to keep our family together?

My mom got me and my brother two dogs over the years but neither lived more than a few months. The first we adopted ate too much chocolate we left on the floor, and I came home to my dad telling me the original owners wanted him back. The second dog, Lobo, was given to us by one of my mom's coworkers. Lobo was an aggressive Dachshund who couldn't get used to my mother's manic screaming and would bark back at her. I didn't know dogs are stressed by changing environments. Every time we moved must have been more difficult for Lobo than for us. In one apartment we stayed in had huge windows and sliding glass doors. My mother's voice echoed through the entire complex. I remember hearing her yelling from buildings away as my stomach tightened into a knot of dread. Life rarely seemed to get easier as my father gambled and lost. We ate white rice, butter, and salt so much the pounding headaches are fixed in my memory. Lobo had such puppy dog eyes as he begged me for anything in my bowl. I often gave a little of what I had. I ate a microwaved bowl of kidney beans and offered beans but he wouldn't eat them. He'd smell eagerly and ignore them, continuing to stare at me with needy eyes. Around that time in 4th grade at the age of 9, I had my first thoughts of suicide. The idea came to me while I walked home under the beating desert sun. How do I stop this pain? A feeling answered, _fall in front of that car._ I saw in my mind's eye my ankle giving out on the next step and my head being crushed under the tire of the upcoming car. I understood that all my pain would be over, but I grew immediately terrified of my end so close. The car sped away and my ankle didn't falter. Simply walking down the street I had to come to grips with this feeling, but I pushed it away. We moved again. As usual, things got better for a while, then worse. My mom was deep into mania for weeks. When Lobo's barking finally got through to her, she picked up Lobo in the kitchen and walked in front of me and my brother while we watched TV. She held Lobo by the throat against our living room wall so we could see her strangle our dog. My body froze as my mind shut down. I couldn't do anything as Lobo broke his silence with yelps I was too distant to hear. She didn't strangle him to death, but she called animal control. That night I sat outside petting Lobo for the last time until the truck arrived with opaque metal cages. The opening was a slit where barely any light could get through. I knew I would be scared to be driven away in the dark. I consoled myself by imagining a purebred Dachshund like Lobo would be adopted quickly. Now I'm old enough to know both of my dogs died cruelly.

Ages 11-15:
My brother and I made friends who became our family. We latched onto normalcy. I spent most of my childhood drawing, reading, and watching several hours of TV per day. I went to school as often as I could which was difficult always moving. I wanted stability but had no firm base. There was a hole where reason should be. I didn't even know I was missing an answer to the fundamental question of _why_. Why did my parents act the way they did? Why did anyone? Why do people suffer?    I interpreted neglect as freedom. I could do or think anything. Daydreaming became a hobby where I would spend an hour in the afternoon laying in bed with my arm over my eyes listening to music, fully immersing myself in an imaginary environment as an observer or character. If I wasn't daydreaming, I was thinking about what was true. Interpreting my mom yelling at my dad as "arguing." I was curious what arguments were. Is truth independent of what anyone believes or says? If I can find truth I can cut through all the mixed messages my parents expressed. I would be free of the painful uncertainty. I grew with Christianity, but by age 11, I questioned how any good god would allow evil in the world. At 14 I couldn't take staying with my parents through homelessness, poverty, and suffering any more. I left to live with friends. My father died tragically when I was 15. Until the last time, my father had psychotic breaks lasting from a few hours to weeks. He would leave and be missing. My dad probably looked a lot like the mentally ill homeless men you might see on the street. The pattern repeated itself in a cycle: he would suddenly be gone, and we would wait to find him. Typically we got a call from the police or a hospital, but this time he wasn't found alive. He collapsed at a bus stop, a place we had waited at so many times. People nearby called an ambulance, but how would you treat a homeless old man laying on the curb? My father died like a dog in the fucking street.

A month later my mom rented a car to attend my father's Marine funeral in Boulder City. It was really a "eral" cause there was no fun. My brother didn't go and only my dad's two sisters attended aside from me and my mom. That day was abysmal. In that moment I decided I would never live with my mother again. With my father gone I had no reason and long ago I lost any attachment. My mother made a scene before the service began. I watched as the funeral director slowly lost his temper with my mom before he yelled at her to leave. With my mother screaming in the car I told her to pull over. Stopping in the middle of the road, I got out and ran. My mom called the police, and soon after I was labeled a runaway. After getting back to Las Vegas and going to class, the high school cops got a statement, cuffed me, and took me to a temporary holding facility. For the longest six weeks of my life I was housed with runaways, drug addicts, law breakers, human trafficking victims, battered women, and more. My daydreaming became a powerful coping mechanism again, as always. Going from a life where I made choices to the monitoring and tracking of a government system was a huge shock. I passed through several homes; none worse than what I'd been through. I kept trying to get back to my friends, the people who proved they cared for me. There was no point being in the system if I couldn't see my friends. Within six months of entering the childcare system, I found a way to live independently under the state and stayed with friends on couches. After major turbulence I was so grateful to have a reliable place to simply live among friends and pursue my education. Before the government check to take care of me went to others, but now the money is under my control.

Ages 16-20:
I was determined to take more action and do what I thought best to the fullest. I've already nearly died a couple of times and everything I knew was taken away from me. I applied for a dual high school/college program and began college at 16. Finally gaining more stability, I wanted constant stimulation, friendship, videos, learning. Looking over the majors at my college I saw new possible paths. I narrowed down to three choices: since childhood I pursued the aesthetics and mastery of art. In psychology, I would find understanding of my parents' affliction and work towards a treatment of the disease. However, the fundamental questions I searched for in psychology were actually philosophical. How can you understand sanity without connecting to reality, so what is reality? What is medication balancing neurotransmitters to and who decides the balance is acceptable? Is medication mind control and should we do that to a person? Philosophy won as the prime major to attempt to answer these questions and train my mind to be resilient and antifragile. If I devoted my life to the treatment of mental disorders, then I would still feel controlled by my history. I wanted to be free, but what is a free, good, meaningful life? To even begin to answer is philosophy. If I were to die in 6 months, what would I do? Well do what is intrinsically worthy and maximally meaningful, philosophy. To be honest, based on what I told you I don't know how you would expect me to be! I am probably far more normal in person than you think. I was friendly and loved talking to people. Being in the flow of conversation and focusing on others let me forget about myself. College was great for meeting people. You can ask almost anyone what their major is, then I wanted to know why. I already had years of experience steering conversation away from me and any sensitive topics. Dodging questions, redirection, following an interesting tangent, these skills allowed me to relate. When you give people space they fill it with their expectations. No one's expectation of me matched my reality, but I focused more on similarity than difference. The big divide between me and other people I assume is that so many people have a guaranteed level of social interaction. School was one of the few places I could meet and talk to people. When I went home, I still interacted with who I lived with, but I was constantly on guard about annoying anyone. If I was too much of a burden, I would have to find a new place to live. I could give all of my social energy to who I met. I was voted the prom king, and I felt so validated in how I was seen. Outside I took up space but at home I tried to take up as little space as possible. I began to play an addictive online game where I could explore a virtual world. There I could go anywhere and be powerful. Computers are like TV but you have even more control. Gaming continued to be my escape and took over every hobby. I graduated high school and transferred directly to my local university. With my status as a former foster kid I had a full ride scholarship. Living through madness fused my will to live with craving for meaning. The more I learned of the world the more strange I felt. Over many years I've pieced together a story of my past. My parents were brutalized minorities suffering in illness at the hands of an ignorant society. My mother took antipsychotic medication while I grew in her womb. So much came to a single point. The government gave us just enough money to barely survive in poverty ridden parts of the city. The severity of my parents' mental illness matched their paired dysfunction. My passive father endured and perpetuated abuses as my mom screamed a stream of background noise. The part of her mind which chatters never silenced, so pressured speech built into quiet talking to yelling as loud as possible all day and into the night. I know I should forgive that terrified child I was whose nature is to trust parents. Mental illness traumatized that child by early separation from his parents twice. I must have had a terrifying and deep fear of losing my parents again. The stress was so great I froze in stasis for years, taking in excessive information, the endless chattering of my mother which I tuned out in favor of anything I could do motionless and silent. I am an outlier, an anomaly. What being before or after has this extreme life?

I searched for answers to the most fundamental questions of reality, knowledge, ethics, and religion. I found few answers and far more questions. I was hurting. I fell into the vices of food and video games to be happy, gaining my heaviest weight in college.

Ages 21-25:
I got fit, quit gaming addictively, and prepared to get a job. I finished my philosophy degree feeling I could _begin_ to study the subject adequately. Graduating at 21, I took an entry level corporate job while I figured life out. At 22, I had a deep intuition for the meaning of life. The artificial intelligence Watson's display of answering questions completely altered my view of what AI was capable of. I quit my job and returned to school to learn computer science to refine and test my ideas. My whole life I studied rationality to defend myself against insanity. I knew I was high risk. When I found purpose, meaning, and direction for my life, complex PTSD nearly destroyed my mind. I stood at the edge of sanity to see as far as I could see. Balancing, I fell over the edge into the abyss. I continue to climb back up. What can a diurnal creature do but crawl towards light? No one knew what I was going through. My memories constantly tricked and confused me. Years of controlling my thoughts had come to haunt me. Before I left my job and lost insurance I visited a psychiatric center for a mental health evaluation. The nurse practitioner told me I should only come back if I had symptoms, and I was fine. I remember the night the problems hit me the hardest. In so many ways I feel Elliott Collin Ploutz died then. I laid down to sleep but stayed awake in the grips of a memory that felt vivid. The most painful scene looped in my mind for hours until I slept in the early morning, waking up a few hours later where the same scene looped in my mind for weeks. The more attention I gave the memory the more it shifted and altered. After years of experiencing this anguish, I think I can communicate the feeling: a waking nightmare. I felt like I was having a constant nightmare in my mind. Sometimes I can tune out the dream and focus on the current moment, but the nightmare pulls me. The horrifying dreams filled every gap in my memory where I was vulnerable. For the future I can prepare. In the present I can act. But I can't make me, the child of my past, grow. There I'm frozen in weakness, and the monsters attacked me. If you want to understand think of the last nightmare you had. Could you think clearly or were you terrified? I'm ashamed to admit that for all my learning and preparation I didn't recognize my experience as mental illness. I was caught up just like a nightmare where I wasn't quite sure what's real. Well my childhood did prepare me to function through crisis at school and with people no matter how I felt on the inside. With how terrible I felt I thought someone would notice a change in me; that I was different from before. Neither side knew what to ask. I didn't know how anyone could help me. I could barely describe my experience. Old friends seem annoyed with my lack of attention. Their misunderstanding made me distant, and I could barely think of what they were going through with little space in my mind. A few times I reached out for medical care I could afford, but the mental health system in our country is horrible. I still battle my mind everyday while stumbling through my chosen path.

Ages 25+:
The sting of failure to reach my standards became familiar, but stopping was not an option. I work towards the purpose I found no matter how small my contribution. Finishing my bachelors degree in computer science in three years while enduring the pain of my trauma, supporting myself, and preparing for graduate school drained me. I studied for and took the GRE prior to my last term which was a rough goodbye from undergraduate studies. In that summer while recovering, my mother was murdered. I want to say it didn't effect me, but I can see now it did. I hated my mother. I hardly said more than a few sentences to her in over ten years. Hearing of her death felt like hearing of a stranger's tragedy. A person I didn't know was killed. The case was never solved. Does anyone care when a poor, mentally ill, old woman is killed? I grew even more distant from my old friends because they knew what happened, and I didn't want to care or pretend to. I always thought when I got into a safe and secure place I could reconnect with my mom on my terms. Slowly I had to accept that would never happen. Any hope of closure was taken from me. The opportunities in graduate school kept me moving forward. Completing my masters in computer science, I exited academia knowing the purely academic life was not me. I never gave up on changing the world. The flaws of our current society pushed me to re-imagine what humans can do. We can flourish as a species and help the biosphere thrive! I have so much I want to do and share. I hope to live up to my personal meaning of life: **I support the search for wisdom**.
