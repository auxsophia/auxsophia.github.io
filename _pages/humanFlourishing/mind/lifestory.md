# My Life Story in 5 Minutes

We should actively take hold of our [narrative self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity) and construct a narrative we desire.

> "The theory of narrative identity postulates that individuals form an identity by integrating their life experiences into an internalized, evolving story of the self that provides the individual with a sense of unity and purpose in life. This life narrative integrates one's reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future. Furthermore, this narrative is a story â€“ it has characters, episodes, imagery, a setting, plots, and themes and often follows the traditional model of a story, having a beginning (initiating event), middle (an attempt and a consequence), and an end (denouement)." -- Wikipedia

5 minutes total seems like a good time limit to me. Of course this won't capture everything, but that is part of the point. Only the most potent words should be used to express your life. By condensing your narrative you identify the driving forces of your life and overarching themes.

[According to one source](https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/06/02/101702_how-fast-average-person-speaks.html) the average person speaks at a rate of 100-130 words per minute (about 4-5 syllables per second). As a rough goal, I will aim for 120 words per minute, 600 words total.

Ages 0-10:
I was born 1991 three years after my older brother. Our parents met in a halfway house for the mentally ill, so they could reintegrate into society. Both of my parents had severe mental illnesses, diseased brains. My father had paranoid schizophrenia and took medication for it most of my life. I don't know if my mother ever had an accurate diagnosis, but my guess is at least schizoaffective disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She stopped taking medication when I was two or three. During her psychotic break she screamed at my father loudly for hours until the police were called. Cops broke down our door, dragged my mom out in front of our apartment and the complex of people, twisted her arm, and pepper-sprayed her. They took me, age 3, and my brother, 6, to government care. Within months the state gave us back to our parents. A kind neighbor realized we couldn't live in that city anymore and drove us from Bakersfield, California to Las Vegas. At the age of 5, while my mother was at work my father had a psychotic break and was so confused about reality he jumped through one of our windows, smashing arms first. The police came again to separate me and my brother from our parents to child haven. While I have few memories of the first separation I remember the second better. I learned how to tie my shoes from a childcare worker. My parents were court ordered to take a parenting class and got us back again. We moved apartments on average every three months to hide from child protective services, save money, and ease my mother's fears. My mom had months of severe mania. She would barely sleep at all and yell incoherent sentences sometimes all day and into the night. We couldn't live anywhere for too long. I remember my father most sitting at whatever kitchen table we had, drinking coffee, endlessly smoking. There are few creatures more stoic than a medicated human being. My childhood was a horror I would not wish on my greatest enemy. _Nothing was safe; nothing was sacred._ No child should live in chaos facing mental, physical, and emotional abuse. My main escape was fantasizing. Constantly daydreaming, I thought of imaginary worlds, other places, whatever didn't involve me. Sometimes I inserted myself as a character too where I had greater power and influence.

Ages 11-15:
My brother and I made friends who became our family. We latched onto normalcy. I spent most of my childhood drawing, reading, and watching several hours of TV per day. I went to school as often as I could which was difficult always moving. I wanted stability but had no firm base. There was a hole where reason should be. I didn't even know I was missing an answer to the fundamental question of _why_. Why did my parents act the way they did? Why did anyone? Why do people suffer? I interpreted neglect as freedom. I could do or think anything. Daydreaming became a hobby where I would spend an hour in the afternoon laying in bed with my arm over my eyes listening to music to fully immerse myself in a different environment as an observer or character. If I wasn't daydreaming I was thinking what was true. Interpreting my mom yelling at my dad as "arguing," I was curious what arguments are. Is truth independent of what anyone believes or says? If I can find truth I can cut through all the mixed messages my parents express. I would be free of the painful uncertainty. I grew with Christianity, but by age 11 I questioned how any good god would allow evil in the world. At 14 I couldn't take staying with my parents through homelessness, poverty, and suffering any more. I left to live with friends. My father died tragically when I was 15. Soon after I was labeled a runaway and picked up by police. They took me to a facility. My daydreaming became a powerful coping mechanism again, as it had always had. Within six months of entering the childcare system I found a way to live independently under the state and stayed with friends on couches. After major turbulence I was so grateful to have a reliable place to simply live among friends and pursue my education.

Ages 16-20:
I was determined to take more action and do what I thought best to the fullest. I've already nearly died twice by this time and everything I knew was taken away from me. I applied for a dual high school/college program and began college at 16. Finally gaining more stability, I tried to live fully. I wanted constant stimulation, friendship, videos, learning. Looking over the majors at my college I saw new possible paths. I narrowed down to three choices: since a child I pursued the aesthetics and mastery of art. In psychology I would find understanding of my parents affliction and work towards a treatment of the disease.  However, the fundamental questions I searched for in psychology were actually philosophical. How can you understand sanity without connecting to reality, so what is reality? What is medication balancing neurotransmitters to and who decides the balance is acceptable? Is medication mind control and should we do that to a person? Philosophy won as the prime major to attempt to answer these questions and train my mind to be resilient and antifragile. If I were to die in 6 months, what would I do? Well do what is intrinsically worthy. Philosophy is enjoyable for its own sake and provides consolation. I graduated high school and transferred directly to my local university. With my status as a former foster kid I had a full ride scholarship. Living through madness fused my will to live with craving for meaning. The more I learned of the world the more strange I felt. Over many years I've pieced together a story of my past. My parents were brutalized minorities suffering in illness at the hands of an ignorant society. My mother took antipsychotic medication while I grew in her womb. So much came to a single point. The government gave us just enough money to barely survive in poverty ridden parts of the city. The severity of my parents' mental illness matched their paired dysfunction. My passive father endured and perpetuated abuses as my mom screamed a stream of background noise. The part of her mind which chatters never silenced, so pressured speech built into quiet talking to yelling as loud as possible all day and into the night. I know I should forgive that terrified child whose nature is to trust parents. That child was traumatized by early separation from his parents twice. I must have had a terrifying and deep fear of losing my parents again. The stress was so great I froze in stasis for years, taking in excessive information, the endless chattering of my mother which I tuned out in favor of anything I could do motionless and silent. I am an outlier, an anomaly. What being before or after has this extreme life?

I searched for answers to the most fundamental questions of reality, knowledge, ethics, and religion. I found few answers and far more questions. I was hurting. I fell into the vices of food and video games to be happy. By the age of six I was obese and my weight fluctuated continually with college being my heaviest.

Ages 21-25:
I got fit, quit gaming addictively, and prepared to get a job. I finished my philosophy degree feeling I could _begin_ to study the subject adequately. Graduating at 21, I took an entry level corporate job while I figured life out. At 22, I had a deep intuition for the meaning of life. The artificial intelligence Watson's display of answering questions completely altered my view of what AI was capable of. I quit my job and returned to school to learn computer science to refine and test my ideas. My whole life I studied rationality to defend myself against insanity. I knew I was high risk. When I found purpose, meaning, and direction for my life, complex PTSD nearly destroyed my mind. I stood at the edge of sanity to see as far as I could see. Balancing, I fell over the edge into the abyss. I continue to climb back up. What can a diurnal creature do but crawl towards light? No one knew what I was going through. My memories constantly tricked and confused me. Now I believe I battle my mental health everyday while then stumbling through my chosen path.

Ages 25+:
The sting of failure to reach my standards became familiar, but stopping was not an option. I work towards the purpose I found no matter how small my contribution. Completing my bachelors and masters in computer science, I exited academia knowing the purely academic life was not me. I never gave up on changing the world. The flaws of our current society pushed me to re-imagine what humans can do. We can flourish as a species and help the biosphere thrive! I have so much I want do and share. I hope to live up to my personal meaning of life: **I support the search for wisdom**.
