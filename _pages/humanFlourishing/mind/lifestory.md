# My Life Story in 5 Minutes

We should actively take hold of our [narrative self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity) and construct a narrative we desire.

> "The theory of narrative identity postulates that individuals form an identity by integrating their life experiences into an internalized, evolving story of the self that provides the individual with a sense of unity and purpose in life. This life narrative integrates one's reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future. Furthermore, this narrative is a story â€“ it has characters, episodes, imagery, a setting, plots, and themes and often follows the traditional model of a story, having a beginning (initiating event), middle (an attempt and a consequence), and an end (denouement)." -- Wikipedia

5 minutes total seems like a good time limit to me. Of course this won't capture everything, but that is part of the point. Only the most potent words should be used to express your life. By condensing your narrative you identify the driving forces of your life and overarching themes.

[According to one source](https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/06/02/101702_how-fast-average-person-speaks.html) the average person speaks at a rate of 100-130 words per minute (about 4-5 syllables per second). As a rough goal, I will aim for 120 words per minute, 600 words total.

Ages 0-10:
I was born 1991 three years after my older brother. Our parents met in a halfway house for the mentally ill, so they could reintegrate into society. Both of my parents had severe mental illnesses, diseased brains. My father had paranoid schizophrenia and took medication for it most of my life. I don't know if my mother ever had an accurate diagnosis, but my guess is at least schizoaffective disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She stopped taking medication when I was two or three. My childhood was a horror I would not wish on my greatest enemy. No child should live in chaos facing mental, physical, and emotional abuse. We moved on average every three months to hide.

Ages 11-15:
My brother and I made friends who became our family. We latched onto normalcy. I spent most of my childhood drawing, reading, and watching several hours of TV per day. I went to school as often as I could which was difficult always moving. Life got harder, but I got smarter. They raised me Christian, but by age 11 I already questioned how any good god would allow evil in the world. At 14 I left home to live with friends. My father died tragically when I was 15. Soon after I was labeled a runaway and picked up by police. Within six months I found a way to live independently under the state and stayed with friends on couches.

Ages 16-20:
I was determined to take control of my life. I applied for a dual high school/college program and began college at 16. I graduated high school and transferred directly to my local university. With my status as a former foster kid I had a full ride scholarship to study my major of choice, philosophy. I searched for answers to the most fundamental questions of reality, knowledge, ethics, and religion. I found few answers and far more questions. I was hurting. I fell into the vices of food and video games to be happy. By the age of six I was obese and my weight fluctuated continually with college being my heaviest.

Ages 21-25:
I got fit, quit gaming addictively, and prepared to get a job. Graduating at 21, I took an entry level corporate job while I figured life out. At 22, I had a deep intuition for the meaning of life. The artificial intelligence Watson's display of answering questions _woke me from my dogmatic slumber_. I quit my job and returned to school to learn computer science to refine and test my ideas. My whole life I studied rationality to defend myself against insanity. I knew I was high risk. When I found purpose, meaning, and direction for my life, complex PTSD nearly destroyed my mind. No one knew what I was going through. My memories constantly tricked me. I was confused myself. I battled my mental health while stumbling through my chosen path.

Ages 25+:
The sting of failure became familiar. I continued to complete my bachelors and masters in computer science, exiting academia knowing the purely academic life was not me. True education is becoming disillusioned. I never gave up on changing the world. The flaws of our current society pushed me to re-imagine what humans can do. We are capable of flourishing, but our society needs to be constructed to support humanist growth. I have so much I want do and share. I hope to live up to my personal meaning of life: I support the search for wisdom.
