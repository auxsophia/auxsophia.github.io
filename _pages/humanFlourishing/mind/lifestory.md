# My Life Story in 5 Minutes

We should actively take hold of our [narrative self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_identity) and construct a narrative we desire.

> "The theory of narrative identity postulates that individuals form an identity by integrating their life experiences into an internalized, evolving story of the self that provides the individual with a sense of unity and purpose in life. This life narrative integrates one's reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future. Furthermore, this narrative is a story â€“ it has characters, episodes, imagery, a setting, plots, and themes and often follows the traditional model of a story, having a beginning (initiating event), middle (an attempt and a consequence), and an end (denouement)." -- Wikipedia

5 minutes total seems like a good time limit to me. Of course this won't capture everything, but that is part of the point. Only the most potent words should be used to express your life. By condensing your narrative you identify the driving forces of your life and overarching themes.

[According to one source](https://wordcounter.net/blog/2016/06/02/101702_how-fast-average-person-speaks.html) the average person speaks at a rate of 100-130 words per minute (about 4-5 syllables per second). As a rough goal, I will aim for 120 words per minute, 600 words total.

Ages 0-10:
I was born 1991 three years after my older brother. Our parents met in a halfway house for the mentally ill, so they could reintegrate into society. Both of my parents had severe mental illnesses, diseased brains. My father had paranoid schizophrenia and took medication for it most of my life. I don't know if my mother ever had an accurate diagnosis, but my guess is at least schizoaffective disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She stopped taking medication when I was two or three. During her psychotic break she screamed at my father loudly for hours until the police were called. Cops broke down our door, dragged my mom out in front of our apartment and the complex of people, twisted her arm, and pepper-sprayed her. They took me, age 3, and my brother, 6, to government care. Within months the state gave us back to our parents. A kind neighbor realized we couldn't live in that city anymore and drove us from Bakersfield, California to Las Vegas. At the age of 5, while my mother was at work my father had a psychotic break and was so confused about reality he jumped through one of our windows, smashing arms first. The police came again to separate me and my brother from our parents to child haven. While I have few memories of the first separation I remember the second better. I learned how to tie my shoes from a childcare worker. My parents were court ordered to take a parenting class and got us back again. We moved apartments on average every three months to hide from child protective services, save money, and ease my mother's fears. My mom had months of severe mania. She would barely sleep at all and yell incoherent sentences sometimes all day and into the night. We couldn't live anywhere for too long. I remember my father most sitting at whatever kitchen table we had, drinking coffee, endlessly smoking. There are few creatures more stoic than a medicated human being. My childhood was a horror I would not wish on my greatest enemy. No child should live in chaos facing mental, physical, and emotional abuse.

Ages 11-15:
My brother and I made friends who became our family. We latched onto normalcy. I spent most of my childhood drawing, reading, and watching several hours of TV per day. I went to school as often as I could which was difficult always moving. I wanted stability but had no firm base. There was a hole where reason should be. I didn't even know I was missing an answer to the fundamental question of _why_. Why did my parents act the way they did? Why did anyone? Why do people suffer? I interpreted neglect as freedom. I could do or think anything. I grew with Christianity, but by age 11 I questioned how any good god would allow evil in the world. At 14 I couldn't take staying with my parents through homelessness, poverty, and suffering any more. I left to live with friends. My father died tragically when I was 15. Soon after I was labeled a runaway and picked up by police. Within six months of entering the childcare system I found a way to live independently under the state and stayed with friends on couches.

Ages 16-20:
I was determined to take control of my life. I applied for a dual high school/college program and began college at 16. Finally gaining more stability, I tried to live fully. I wanted constant stimulation, friendship, videos, learning. I graduated high school and transferred directly to my local university. With my status as a former foster kid I had a full ride scholarship to study my major of choice, philosophy. Living through madness fused my will to live with craving for meaning. I searched for answers to the most fundamental questions of reality, knowledge, ethics, and religion. I found few answers and far more questions. I was hurting. I fell into the vices of food and video games to be happy. By the age of six I was obese and my weight fluctuated continually with college being my heaviest.

Ages 21-25:
I got fit, quit gaming addictively, and prepared to get a job. Graduating at 21, I took an entry level corporate job while I figured life out. At 22, I had a deep intuition for the meaning of life. The artificial intelligence Watson's display of answering questions completely altered my view of what AI was capable of. I quit my job and returned to school to learn computer science to refine and test my ideas. My whole life I studied rationality to defend myself against insanity. I knew I was high risk. When I found purpose, meaning, and direction for my life, complex PTSD nearly destroyed my mind. No one knew what I was going through. My memories constantly tricked me. I was confused myself. I battled my mental health everyday while stumbling through my chosen path.

Ages 25+:
The sting of failure to reach my standards became familiar. Completing my bachelors and masters in computer science, I exited academia knowing the purely academic life was not me. I never gave up on changing the world. The flaws of our current society pushed me to re-imagine what humans can do. We can flourish as a species and help the biosphere thrive! I have so much I want do and share. I hope to live up to my personal meaning of life: **I support the search for wisdom**.
