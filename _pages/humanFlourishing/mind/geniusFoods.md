# Genius Foods

[By Max Lugavere with Paul Grewal, MD](https://www.geniusfoodsbook.com/)

"Discover the critical link between your brain and the food you eat and change the way your brain ages, in this cutting-edge, practical guide to eliminating brain fog, optimizing brain health, and achieving peak mental performance from media personality and leading voice in health Max Lugavere.

After his mother was diagnosed with a mysterious form of dementia, Max Lugavere put his successful media career on hold to learn everything he could about brain health and performance. For the better half of a decade, he consumed the most up-to-date scientific research, talked to dozens of leading scientists and clinicians around the world, and visited the country’s best neurology departments—all in the hopes of understanding his mother’s condition.

Now, in _Genius Foods_, Lugavere presents a comprehensive guide to brain optimization. He uncovers the stunning link between our dietary and lifestyle choices and our brain functions, revealing how the foods you eat directly affect your ability to focus, learn, remember, create, analyze new ideas, and maintain a balanced mood.

Weaving together pioneering research on dementia prevention, cognitive optimization, and nutritional psychiatry, Lugavere distills groundbreaking science into actionable lifestyle changes. He shares invaluable insights into how to improve your brain power, including

the nutrients that can boost your memory and improve mental clarity (and where to find them);
the foods and tactics that can energize and rejuvenate your brain, no matter your age;
a brain-boosting fat-loss method so powerful it has been called “biochemical liposuction”; and
the foods that can improve your happiness, both now and for the long term.
With _Genius Foods_, Lugavere offers a cutting-edge yet practical road map to eliminating brain fog and optimizing the brain’s health and performance today—and decades into the future."

**Genius Foods**

1. Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
2. Avocados
3. Blueberries
4. Dark Chocolate
5. Eggs
6. Grass-Fed Beef
7. Dark Leafy Greens
8. Broccoli
9. Wild Salmon
10. Almonds

This diet is designed to balance the fed and fasted states. Insulin regulation is key for brain health.

4. Dark chocolate - unfortunately he says to eat chocolate that has NOT been processed with alkali which destroys many of the beneficial phytonutrients. You can check this on the label. Sadly my go to 90%+ dark chocolate from the store has alkali!

Creatine supplements are key for vegetarians, but regular meat eaters (fish/red meat) are unlikely to need more.

8. Add cruciferous vegetables to your diet both raw and cooked. Add mustard powder to cooked cruciferous vegetables to protect important phytonutrients from cooking.

Low levels of the hormone leptin can cause anhedonia (a lack of pleasure and happiness) and social withdrawal! Sleep heavily effects leptin. Intermittent fasting helps leptin regulation. Having refeed days of carbs and low fat keeps leptin levels stable. Eat your carbs on workout days. A high carb day is 150g of carbs where most Americans eat 300g of carbs on average. Low carb is 30-80g. Ketogenic diets hover around 30g carbs. The minimum necessary carbs for healthy brain function is 30g and lower causes serious health decline.

He discusses the "virtues of stress" and quotes the anti-fragility author directly! He argues for anabolic exercise and HIIT.

Avoid emulsifiers in nutmilks. Avoid aluminum in deoderant.

| Quercetin | Onions | Strengthens gut barrier integrity and reduces permeability |
| Anthocyanins | Blueberries | Reduces cognitive aging and Alzheimer's risk |
| Fisetin | Strawberries, cucumbers | Reduces brain inflammation, protects from cognitive decline |

### Custom Carb Pyramid (3 Tiers)

Ultra-low/Ketogenic (Days 1-14)

- Consume only 20-40 grams of carbohydrates per day
- Depletes glycogen stores and gets brain fat adapted
- "If you are eating this way longer-term for weight loss, add a one-time weekly high-carb refeed. This means you can indulge in higher-starch foods (aim to keep the meal low-fat) to replenish muscle energy stores once a week. There's no magic number, but shoot for 100 to 150 grams of carbs with that meal."

Low(er) carb (after 14 days)

- Consume 50-75g of carbs per day
- "People who are looking for weight maintenance and perform light physical activity should stay at this level."

Optional: Carb cycling

- Carb intake can increase after vigorous training
- Consume 75-150g carbs per day (heavy workout days)
- Still vastly lower than average American diet
