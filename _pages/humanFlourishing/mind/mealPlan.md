title: Philosopher Scholar - Meal Plan Recipes
permalink: /mealPlan/
---

A random list of recipes and foods that support my goals of [nutrition](/nutrition/). I'll be adding to this list occasionally.

Drinking a glass of red wine, cabernet sauvignon, with a small handful of frozen blueberries everyday will take care of two of the requirements. Flash frozen fruits and vegetables carry more nutrients than food that has degraded in transit.

# The current goal is 14 meal recipes and 7 snacks.

In a week of intermittent fasting, that means meals for lunch and dinner with a snack (linner) in between. This gives variety everyday and most likely meals will be repeated in the same week, creating a rotation.

## Snacks
---

Nuts

- Walnuts
- Pistachios
- Almonds (require a lot of water to grow)
- Pecans
- Cashews
- Macadamia

---

Sourdough bread toasted with sauerkraut on top (optionally add yellowfin tuna or avocado)
