> If you are anxious you are living in the future.

> If you are at peace you are living in the present."

Grounding techniques help to refocus us in the present moment. They are extremely useful for mindfulness and dealing with trauma, anxiety, and depression. Grounding is highly personal. The good news is there are many techniques to try until something works for you. Here's a short list of lists, [30 techniques](https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques), [25 techniques for anxiety](https://choosementalhealth.org/25-grounding-techniques-for-anxiety/), and [101 techniques](https://www.beautyafterbruises.org/blog/grounding101). The techniques are categorized according to mental (focusing your mind), physical (focusing your senses), and soothing (talking to yourself in a kind way). Here's a popular [PDF on creating personal calm](https://www2.winona.edu/resilience/media/grounding-worksheet.pdf). I'll also add breathing techniques separate from physical and give my top three from each category.

## Breathing

1. Box breathing

Breathe in for four seconds - hold for four second - breathe out for four seconds - hold for four seconds - repeat.

2. Exhale longer

It's simple and incredibly effective: take deep breaths and exhale longer than you inhale.

3. Mindful breathing

Don't try to change your breathing just act as a mirror to it, be aware of it. You may find you're breathing short breaths in your upper chest.

## Physical

1. Clench and unclench your fist

Bring your focus to your hand and feel the tension and release.

2. Touch all your fingertips together and make small circles

3. Hold a grounding object and bring your attention to it. I like an amethyst stone.

## Mental

1. Describe your environment

Often suggested as 5-4-3-2-1, go through your senses and describe your environment from sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste. I find this to be a bit much, but connecting to all senses is key.

2. Humor

Find something funny!

3. Watch some content

A movie or show

## Soothing

1. Say a coping statement such as, "this too shall pass"

2. Think of what you have to look forward to

3. Think of your favorite things, people, shows, etc.
