"The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or more commonly, the MIND diet, combines the portions of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet.[[1]](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/mind-diet) Both the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet have been shown to improve cognition; however, neither were developed to slow neurodegeneration (e.g. Alzheimer's disease).[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849169/) Therefore, a team at Rush University Medical Center, headed by Martha Clare Morris (a nutritional epidemiologist), worked to create the MIND diet.[[3]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00194-6/fulltext) Like the DASH and Mediterranean diets, the MIND diet emphasizes the intake of fresh fruit, vegetables, and legumes.[[4]](https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(15)01251-4/fulltext) The MIND diet also includes recommendations for specific foods, like leafy greens and berries, that have been scientifically shown to slow cognitive decline.[[3]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00194-6/fulltext) Recent research has shown that the MIND diet is more effective at reducing cognitive decline than either the Mediterranean or DASH diets alone.[[3]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00194-6/fulltext) Additional testing has shown that the level of adherence to the MIND diet also impacts the diet's neuro-protective effects.[[5]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00017-5/fulltext)" - [via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_diet)
