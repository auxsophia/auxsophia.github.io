> "The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or more commonly, the MIND diet, combines portions of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet.[[1]](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/mind-diet) Both the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet have been shown to improve cognition; however, neither were developed to slow neurodegeneration (e.g. Alzheimer's disease).[[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849169/) Therefore, a team at Rush University Medical Center, headed by Martha Clare Morris (a nutritional epidemiologist), worked to create the MIND diet.[[3]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00194-6/fulltext) Like the DASH and Mediterranean diets, the MIND diet emphasizes the intake of fresh fruit, vegetables, and legumes.[[4]](https://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(15)01251-4/fulltext) The MIND diet also includes recommendations for specific foods, like leafy greens and berries, that have been scientifically shown to slow cognitive decline.[[3]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00194-6/fulltext) Recent research has shown that the MIND diet is more effective at reducing cognitive decline than either the Mediterranean or DASH diets alone.[[3]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00194-6/fulltext) Additional testing has shown that the level of adherence to the MIND diet also impacts the diet's neuro-protective effects.[[5]](https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(15)00017-5/fulltext)" - [via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_diet)

# Abstract from Nutrition and risk of dementia: overview and methodological issues.
> "After little more than two decades of research on nutrition and dementia, there is strong evidence for preventive effects of vitamin E, B vitamins, and n-3 fatty acids, and deleterious effects of saturated fat, on dementia. Among specific foods with evidence of neuroprotection are green leafy vegetables and other vegetables, berries, and seafood. A number of studies have examined dietary patterns, particularly the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets; neither of these diets is tailored to the specific foods and nutrients that have been identified as neuroprotective. A new diet, called MIND (Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), incorporates many elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets but with modifications that reflect the best evidence for brain neuroprotection. The evidence in support of the relation of various nutrients and the Mediterranean diet to dementia has been inconsistent. The seeming inconsistencies may be explained by inattention to nutrient/food intake levels in the interpretation of study findings and trial design. This includes a shifting metric among studies for scoring adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Future studies should pay particular attention to levels of intake in the design and analyses of nutritional studies."

> “One of the more exciting things about this is that people who adhered even moderately to the MIND diet had a reduction in their risk for AD,” said Morris. “I think that will motivate people.”

> Morris and her colleagues developed the MIND diet based on information that has accrued from years’ worth of past research about what foods and nutrients have good, and bad, effects on the functioning of the brain over time. This is the first study to related the MIND diet to Alzheimer’s disease.

I'm putting together [a list of recipes for myself.](/humanFlourishing/mind/MINDdietRecipes/)

"The factors that play into individuals’ neurocognitive development to peak intelligence may or may not be the same as those that cause neurodegeneration," [Nutrition and risk of dementia: overview and methodological issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849169/).

> However, the MIND diet uniquely specifies green leafy vegetables and berries as well as servings of food components that reflect the nutrition–dementia study findings. Among the different types of vegetables, the green leafy variety has been identified as having the strongest protective effects against cognitive decline.42–44 In the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the rate of decline among those who consumed 1–2 servings per day was the equivalent of being 11 years younger in age compared with those who rarely or never consumed green leafy vegetables.44 Green leafy vegetables are rich sources of lutein, folate, vitamin E, beta carotene, and polyphenols, nutrients that have been related to brain health. Prospective epidemiological studies of dementia do not observe a protective benefit from the consumption of fruits in general.42,43,45,46 Dietary intakes of berries, however, have been demonstrated to improve memory and brain neuroprotection in multiple animal studies47 and to slow cognitive decline in the Nurses’ Health Study.48 However, certain food components and servings of the DASH and Mediterranean diets are not included in the MIND diet because there is a lack of evidence for their importance for brain health, including high consumption of fruits (3–4 servings in both the DASH and Mediterranean),41,49 dairy (DASH),49 and potatoes and high fish consumption (2 servings/day and 6 meals/week, respectively, in the Mediterranean diet41). The MIND diet recommends one or more fish meals per week on the basis of prospective study evidence that this frequency is sufficient to lower dementia risk and that there is no additional benefit evident from higher servings per week.50–52 The MIND diet does include many other food components of the DASH or Mediterranean diets, including extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, whole grains, and low-fat sources of protein, such as legumes and poultry. - [Nutrition and risk of dementia: overview and methodological issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849169/).

> It is important that the findings of protective relations of the MIND diet score and cognitive decline are replicated in other cohort studies to confirm these associations. To establish a causal relation between diet and prevention of dementia, a diet intervention trial is required. Modifications to the MIND diet score would be expected as new foods and nutrients are identified from scientific advances in the field of nutrition and brain neurodegeneration, a field that is currently underdeveloped.

> Use of absolute levels of intake of foods and food categories has several advantages over relative cut-offs based on within-population levels of intake. First, findings across studies are more interpretable when they have a common metric. Second, important information about the optimum level of brain benefit for different dietary components becomes known when the data are analyzed and presented in terms of servings per day across different studies in different populations. And third, the scientific findings on optimum nutrition for brain health can be more easily translated to the general public when framed in terms of servings per day. One advantage of the MIND diet score is that the scoring for each dietary component is based on absolute as opposed to relative levels of intake. For many of the dietary components (e.g., seafood, vegetables), the intake levels required for optimum scores were based on direct scientific evidence for brain health. For other dietary components (e.g., whole grains, poultry), direct evidence for brain health is lacking and optimum scores are based on the cardiovascular disease literature.

## [MIND diet slows cognitive decline with aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4581900/)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Table 1]({{ site.baseimg }}/images/MIND_score.png)
{: refdef}

> In this community-based study of older persons, we investigated the relation of diet to change in cognitive function using an á priori-defined diet composition score (MIND) based on the foods and nutrients shown to be protective for dementia. Higher MIND diet score was associated with slower decline in cognitive abilities. The rate reduction for persons in the highest tertile of diet scores compared with the lowest tertile was the equivalent of being 7.5 years younger in age. Strong associations of the MIND diet were observed with the global cognitive measure as well as with each of five cognitive domains. The strength of the estimated effect was virtually unchanged after statistical control for many of the important confounders, including physical activity and education as well as with the exclusion of individuals with the lowest baseline cognitive scores.

> However, the MIND diet uniquely specifies consumption of berries and green leafy vegetables, and does not specify high fruit consumption (both DASH and Mediterranean), high dairy (DASH), high potato consumption or greater than 1 fish meal per week (Mediterranean). The MIND modifications highlight the foods and nutrients shown through the scientific literature to be associated with dementia prevention...Studies of fish consumption observed lower risk of dementia with just 1 fish meal a week with no additional benefit evident for higher servings per week. Thus, the highest possible score for this component of the MIND diet score is attributed to one or more servings per week...Fish are a rich source of long-chain n-3 fatty acids which have been shown to reduce Aβ formation and oxidative damage, and to increase synaptic proteins and dendritic spine density.

> The study findings are supported by a number of strengths including the prospective study design with up to 10 years of follow-up, annual assessment of cognitive function using a battery of standardized tests, comprehensive assessment of diet using a validated questionnaire, and statistical control of the important confounding factors. Another important strength is that the MIND diet score was devised based on expansive reviews of studies relating diet to brain function.

> A limitation of the study is that the dietary questionnaire had few questions to measure some of the dietary components and limited information on frequency of consumption. For example, a single item each provided information on consumption of nuts, berries (strawberries), beans, and olive oil. However, this imprecision in the measurement of the MIND score would tend to underestimate the diet effect on cognitive decline. Another limitation is the self-report of diet which some studies suggest can lead to biased reporting in overweight and cognitively impaired adults. Concern that biased diet reporting could explain the findings is mitigated by the fact that statistical control for factors like obesity, education, age, and physical activity had no impact on the estimated MIND diet effect and the association remained strong in analyses that omitted the participants with MCI and whose diet scores changed over the study period. Further we observed no modification in the effect by level of these potential confounders.

> The primary limitation of the study is that it is observational and thus the findings cannot be interpreted as a cause and effect relation. Replication of the findings in other cohort studies is important for confirmation of the association, however, a diet intervention trial is required to establish a causal relation between diet and prevention of cognitive decline. Further, the findings were based on an old, largely non-Hispanic white study population and cannot be generalized to younger populations or different racial/ethnic groups.

> The MIND diet is a refinement of the extensively studied cardiovascular diets, the Mediterranean and DASH diets, with modifications based on the scientific literature relevant to nutrition and the brain. This literature is underdeveloped and therefore, modifications to the MIND diet score would be expected as new scientific advances are made.

# Genius Foods

[By Max Lugavere with Paul Grewal, MD](https://www.geniusfoodsbook.com/)

"Discover the critical link between your brain and the food you eat and change the way your brain ages, in this cutting-edge, practical guide to eliminating brain fog, optimizing brain health, and achieving peak mental performance from media personality and leading voice in health Max Lugavere.

After his mother was diagnosed with a mysterious form of dementia, Max Lugavere put his successful media career on hold to learn everything he could about brain health and performance. For the better half of a decade, he consumed the most up-to-date scientific research, talked to dozens of leading scientists and clinicians around the world, and visited the country’s best neurology departments—all in the hopes of understanding his mother’s condition.

Now, in _Genius Foods_, Lugavere presents a comprehensive guide to brain optimization. He uncovers the stunning link between our dietary and lifestyle choices and our brain functions, revealing how the foods you eat directly affect your ability to focus, learn, remember, create, analyze new ideas, and maintain a balanced mood.

Weaving together pioneering research on dementia prevention, cognitive optimization, and nutritional psychiatry, Lugavere distills groundbreaking science into actionable lifestyle changes. He shares invaluable insights into how to improve your brain power, including

the nutrients that can boost your memory and improve mental clarity (and where to find them);
the foods and tactics that can energize and rejuvenate your brain, no matter your age;
a brain-boosting fat-loss method so powerful it has been called “biochemical liposuction”; and
the foods that can improve your happiness, both now and for the long term.
With _Genius Foods_, Lugavere offers a cutting-edge yet practical road map to eliminating brain fog and optimizing the brain’s health and performance today—and decades into the future."

**Genius Foods**

1. Extra-Virgin Olive Oil
2. Avocados
3. Blueberries
4. Dark Chocolate
5. Eggs
6. Grass-Fed Beef
7. Dark Leafy Greens
8. Broccoli
9. Wild Salmon
10. Almonds

This diet is designed to balance the fed and fasted states. Insulin regulation is key for brain health.


4. Dark chocolate - unfortunately he says to eat chocolate that has NOT been processed with alkali which destroys many of the beneficial phytonutrients. You can check this on the label. Sadly my go to 90%+ dark chocolate from the store has alkali!

Creatine supplements are key for vegetarians, but regular meat eaters (fish/red meat) are unlikely to need more.

8. Add cruciferous vegetables to your diet both raw and cooked. Add mustard powder to cooked cruciferous vegetables to protect important phytonutrients from cooking.

Low levels of the hormone leptin can cause anhedonia (a lack of pleasure and happiness) and social withdrawal! Sleep heavily effects leptin. Intermittent fasting helps leptin regulation. Having refeed days of carbs and low fat keeps leptin levels stable. Eat your carbs on workout days. A high carb day is 150g of carbs where most Americans eat 300g of carbs on average. Low carb is 30-80g. Ketogenic diets hover around 30g carbs. The minimum necessary carbs for healthy brain function is 30g and lower causes serious health decline.

He discusses the "virtues of stress" and quotes the anti-fragility author directly! He argues for anabolic exercise and HIIT.

### Custom Carb Pyramid (3 Tiers)

Ultra-low/Ketogenic (Days 1-14)

- Consume only 20-40 grams of carbohydrates per day
- Depletes glycogen stores and gets brain fat adapted
- "If you are eating this way longer-term for weight loss, add a one-time weekly high-carb refeed. This means you can indulge in higher-starch foods (aim to keep the meal low-fat) to replenish muscle energy stores once a week. There's no magic number, but shoot for 100 to 150 grams of carbs with that meal."

Low(er) carb (after 14 days)
- Consume 50-75g of carbs per day
- "People who are looking for weight maintenance and perform light physical activity should stay at this level."

Optional: Carb cycling

- Carb intake can increase after vigorous training
- Consume 75-150g carbs per day (heavy workout days)
- Still vastly lower than average American diet

Honestly I didn't think I would read a book that would change my mind about the MINDDiet. Genius Foods modifies the MINDDiet. It can fit the framework. What's tough is that many nutritionists and cognitive-optimizers have recommended ketosis for brain benefits. People disagree on proper carb intake. I have to say I'm amazed and thoroughly convinced by _Deep Nutrition: Why Your Genes Need Traditional Food_, Catherine Shanahan, M.D.

Dr. Shanahan argues we can separate traditional foods (indigenous diets) into four neat categories. We need to eat these as often as we can, preferably daily.

## 4 Pillars of the Human Diet
* Meat cooked on the bone
* Organ meat
* Fresh, raw plant and animal products
* Fermented and sprouted foods

"Proved to be essential by virtue of their ubiquitousness." They proved to be successful by the robust health of their followers.

Shanahan argues health and beauty come from the fabric of the universe. Beautiful people are beautiful because of their health and nutrition. Our genetics have rules for how to grow and develop that are naturally appealing, like the fibonacci sequence and fractals. Poor health and nutrition distort the natural processes and symmetry resulting in unattractive traits. Tough foods that require us to chew help shape developing mouths. Animals in the wild don't need braces ever! We only need braces now largely because we eat softer foods from cooking. Our foods are now ultra-soft because they were designed that way.

We're eating an unusual "astronaut" diet never seen in human history before! From babies drinking human designed formula to the packaged and preservative filled foods we eat from the grocery store, we have yet to see the full impact our diet has on health.  

Antioxidant supplements can cause oxidative stress or do nothing to help if the chemical environment is not supportive of antioxidation. Vegetable oils must be removed from the diet.

We should cook meat on the bone, especially stews. Cook with skin and fat on. Nutrients are more bio-available after slow cooking. If something has natural foods and each bite packs powerful flavor, that's where the nutrients are most free and absorbed by the body.

If there's an excess of protein, sugar, vitamins, and minerals aside from calcium and phosphorous, part is stored in the liver until needed. "Liver is therefore the most outstanding meat which can be purchased." However, mass-farmed animals likely have low nutrient density and don't have much excess.

Plants have natural defenses because they don't want to be eaten! Plants spend a great deal of energy thwarting grazers. To a lesser degree, even fruit has defenses. They don't want to be grazed to extinction. Fermenting and sprouting counteracts these defenses. Simultaneously these practices help to preserve food naturally and safely. Cheese is fermented in a way where the microbiomes devour the sugar and leave nutrients behind.

Raw milk is very healthy. Pasteurized not better for an individual but for mass production. Milk is one of the few substances meant to actually nurture another creature.

Chapter 15 covers losing body weight through food. Calories in calories out ignores the information food sends to your body. Cells are communicating and understanding on a chemical level. _Food as information!_

Sugar is pro-inflammatory. 100g or more of sugar a day traps carbs at your liver and converts to fat.

Chapter 13 covers the "human diet" in more detail. Each pillar is to be seen as a strategy which can be incorporated to many diets. The below lists are examples of the four strategies we should all incorporate.

1. Meat on the bone

- Roast turkey with stuffing and gravy
- Chicken soup with dumplings
- _Chile con carne_
- Barbecued spare ribs
- Mexican _menudo_ soup
- _Pico de gallo_ soup
- Thai _thom kha gai_ soup
- Vietnamese _pho_
- Braised lamb shanks
- Southwestern green chile stew
- Grilled New York strip steak with demi-glace reduction sauce
- Burger (no bun) with mushroom in demi-glace reduction sauce.
- Wild rice cooked in chicken stock
- Greens braised in chicken stock
- Roasted butternut squash soup with chicken base stock base
- Broccoli soup with chicken stock base
- French onion soup
- Beef Bourguignon

2. Organ meat

- Sandy's miracle liver recipe (recipe in book)
- Pakistani fried chicken liver
- Duck liver pate
- Chicken liver pate (i.e., Trader Joe's brand)
- Liverwurst (i.e., US Wellness Meats brand)
- Grilled beef heart strips
- Beef heart chili
- Beef sticks and organ meat (i.e., Pure Traditions brand)
- Filipino salmon head soup
- Roasted bone marrow
- Wild flying fish roe on buttered sprouted grain toast
- Mexican _menudo_ with tripe
- Vietnamese _pho_ with tripe
- Blood sausage
- Filipino _dinuguan_ (savory blood stew made with pork shoulder and variety cuts)
- Sauteed sweetbreads with fava beans
- Beef tongue stew
- Pan fried lamb kidneys in butter
- Poached eggs (If you can't do any of the above, eggs have many of the same benefits as organ meats. Keeping the yolk runny is the most nutritious way to eat eggs.)

3. Fermented and sprouted foods

(Note: Those marked "LC" contain beneficial probiotics. Those not marked no longer contain living microbes.)

- Yogurt (LC)
- Cottage cheese (LC)
- Sour cream (LC)
- Pepperoni
- Cheddar cheese
- Kombucha (LC)
- Sauerkraut (LC)
- Dill pickles (LC)
- Kimchi (LC)
- Tempeh
- Miso
- Fish sauce
- Soy Sauce (only if naturally brewed, i.e., Kikkoman brand)
- Beer
- Sourdough bread
- Sprouted grain bread (i.e., Ezekiel brand)
- _Chile con carne_ with sprouted beans
- Sprouted almonds (i.e., Living Intentions or Go Raw brands)
- Old-fashioned oat porridge (oats fermented with whey overnight)
- Sprouted pumpkin seeds (i.e., Living Intentions or Go Raw brands)

(If beer is in here, I assume red wine should be on the list too!)

4. Fresh, raw food

- Garlic
- Salad greens
- Bell peppers
- Any vegetable you can eat without cooking
- Cilantro (and other fresh herbs)
- Poke
- Real milk and cream
- Ice cream
- Sushi
- Raw-milk cheeses
- Steak tartar
- Dried beef
- Prosciutto
- Pickled veggies (i.e., Mezzetta brand Giardiniera Italian mix)
- Dried seaweed
- Nuts
- Seeds
- Pickled herring in cream or wine sauce
- _Ceviche_
- Antipasto salad

"The people who experience long-term success are able to accomplish these three things: cut down on carbs; swap out toxic fats for healthy ones; and add back missing nutrients. That's it."

#### Daily habits

- Drink a minimum of 64 ounces of water daily.
- Instead of soda, drink ice-cold sparkling water with a lemon wedge, herbal tea, or kombucha.
- For best results, do not snack.
- Take any supplements with meals.
- Consider sleep and movement as priorities.
- Plan your meals using the shopping and planning templates.

#### Macronutrient ratios

**Carbs**

"If you only exercise moderately -- jogging, tennis, biking, swimming -- but don't make exercise a central part of your daily life, then you should consider 100 grams of daily carbohydrate intake to be your upper limit. Even so, most days you're better off keeping daily carbohydrate totals between 30 and 70 grams, because every gram of carbohydrates you consume but don't use to fuel intense activity (anaerobic exercise) must either get stored as fat or be burned as fuel."

Most carbs should be eaten at dinner.

"If you're an elite athlete who burns 600 calories or more calories a day doing intense exercises like sprinting or heavy lifting, those calories should come from an optimized balance of carb and fat."

**Protein**

(Female/Male)

Minimum: 50/70g
Maximum: 120/150g

Beyond the maximum range your body converts protein to carbs/fat. Certain elite athletes can use more protein than the maximum.

**Fat**

Recommended 60-85% of daily calories from healthy fat. This ratio is very different from the standard American diet which substitutes carbs for fat with 50% of daily calories going to carbs.

The author recommends following your appetite as a guide, but at first vegetable oils and high sugar intake can make your cravings "deranged." The author recommends getting rid of habitual eating and paying attention to your body. Additionally, the best calorie calculators can be off by 30% or more based on variables such as genetics, age, activity, sleep, stress, and metabolic/hormonal health.
