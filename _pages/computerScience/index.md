## "If it has science in the name, it's not a science." - Anonymous

I'm currently reading selected parts of **Algorithms to Live By - The Computer Science of Human Decisions** by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. The book is awesome so far. The only downside is they don't explicitly list their references in their work. It's just a long bibliography in the back. I'm breaking down chapter 5 of their book on [scheduling](./scheduling-humans/) (time management).
