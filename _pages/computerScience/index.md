## "If it has science in the name, it's not a science." - Anonymous

I'm currently reading selected parts of **Algorithms to Live By - The Computer Science of Human Decisions** by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. The book is awesome so far. The only downside is they don't explicitly list their references in their work. It's just a long bibliography in the back. I'm breaking down chapter 5 of their book on [scheduling](./schedulingHumans/) (time management).

# A list of some of my projects

From oldest to newest.

#### [A Zappos 2016 Coding Challenge](https://challenge.zappos.biz/problems/pouring-buckets/index.html)

[my submission](https://github.com/auxsophia/Zappos2016) (Python)

They paid for all the food and drinks ordered, so that immediately lured me in. I also wanted the challenge. I wasn't the fastest that year, but participating lit a fire in me to compete again and win. In a coding interview years later, I was asked the bucket problem and was able to solve the problem and explain my thought process on the spot. Just attempting the problem was a fun and exciting way to learn.

#### [Jaemi signing "Hello, world"](https://github.com/auxsophia/Jaemi-DRC) (C++)

A forked project for a humanoid robot. The UNLV robotics lab in which I studied from the fall of 2014 to summer 2015 participated in the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge obtaining 8th place in the finals in an international competition. I watched over our booth and worked with an older model humanoid, Jaemi. I trained in the maintenance, operation, and coding of Jaemi. For the challenge, I programmed Jaemi to perform "hello, world" in sign language. Unfortunately, Jaemi's fingers were broken for the challenge (probably from a bad night of gambling at Las Vegas casinos), and I was never able to execute my code.

#### [Synesthesia](https://github.com/auxsophia/Synesthesia) (C#)

Created in fulfillment of the fall 2015 senior design course. My project won me 1st place in computer science with a $1,500 prize. Details in the poster below.

#### [Heroes and Villains](https://github.com/auxsophia/heroes-and-villains) (HTML/CSS/Javascript - Meteor framework)

A team project to fulfill the requirements of CS 620: a graduate level course in human-computer interaction.
