The intelligence explosion idea was expressed by statistician I.J. Good in 1965:

> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion’, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.[1](https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/#WhatIsTheIntelligence)

### [A reply to Francois Chollet on intelligence explosion](https://intelligence.org/2017/12/06/chollet/)

"This is a reply to Francois Chollet, the inventor of the Keras wrapper for the Tensorflow and Theano deep learning systems, on his essay [“The impossibility of intelligence explosion.”](https://intelligence.org/2017/12/06/chollet/)"

It gets vicious, bro! Academically vicious! He calls out his tweets. It's a little called for. Francois is pejorative towards intelligence explosion.
