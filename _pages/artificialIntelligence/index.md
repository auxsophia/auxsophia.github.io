## Resources for Learning AI

The standard text used everywhere is [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by [Stuart Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell) and [Peter Norvig](https://norvig.com/), the godfathers of AI.

There is an online course by Udacity lead by Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun, [Introduction to AI](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271).

The Introduction to AI course by Udacity is advanced. For a person starting at the foundations and building up, my recommended path is given below:

Finland recognizes the revolution of AI and created a training program so 1% of all its citizens could be educated in AI, AI-literate. Their course [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) made by the University of Helsinki is made for the average person to be able to understand and speak intelligently about AI's impact. The Elements of AI is a great foundational course because it goes into just enough depth to communicate an intuition for the working of an algorithm (and a definition of what an algorithm is). The course is offered in several language, so you might find people from around the world who have the same base as you.

After this course, you should continue on to the Udacity course.
