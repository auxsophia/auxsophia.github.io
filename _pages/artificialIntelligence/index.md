The standard text used everywhere is [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by [Stuart Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell) and [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/), the godfathers of AI.

There is an online course by Udacity lead by Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun, [Introduction to AI](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271).
