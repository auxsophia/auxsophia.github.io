Some have the false idea that philosophy is about short quotes and pithy sayings. Philosophy is so much more, but damn are some quotes inspiring, illuminating, and cool.

# Bruce Lee

Cease negative mental chattering. - If you think a thing is impossible, you'll make it impossible.

A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.

### Make at least one definite move daily toward your goal.

Don't fear failure. Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts, it is glorious even to fail.

If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.

Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.

Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.

### It's not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.

Concentration is the root of all the higher abilities in man.

To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities.

Ultimately the greatest help is self-help.

What is is more important than what should be.

Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.

As you think, so shall you become.

Those who are unaware they are walking in darkness will never seek the light.

### Do not pray for an easy life; pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.

If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done.

A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.

The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.

Defeat is a state of mind; no one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality.

### I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

"Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many.

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." - Albert Einstein

"We have come from God, and inevitably the myths woven by us, though they contain error, will also reflect a splintered fragment of the true light, the eternal truth that is with God.  Indeed only by myth-making, only by becoming 'sub-creator' and inventing stories, can Man aspire to the state of perfection that he knew before the Fall.  Our myths may be misguided, but they steer however shakily towards the true harbour, while materialistic 'progress' leads only to a yawning abyss and the Iron Crown of the power of evil." - J.R.R.

"The only position that leaves me with no cognitive dissonance is atheism. It is not a creed. Death is certain, replacing both the siren-song of Paradise and the dread of Hell. Life on this earth, with all its mystery and beauty and pain, is then to be lived far more intensely: we stumble and get up, we are sad, confident, insecure, feel loneliness and joy and love.

But that also makes it the most valuable time you have, as you alone stand to reap the profits from spending it wisely." - Jarod Kintz, I Should Have Renamed This

"Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?

"Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. <br/><br/>Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend." - Bruce Lee

"The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice.

"I Keep Six Honest Serving Men ..." <br/><br/>I keep six honest serving-men<br/> (They taught me all I knew);<br/>Their names are What and Why and When <br/> And How and Where and Who.<br/><br/>I send them over land and sea,<br/> I send them east and west;<br/>But after they have worked for me,<br/> I give them all a rest.<br/><br/>I let them rest from nine till five,<br/> For I am busy then,<br/>As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,<br/> For they are hungry men.<br/><br/>But different folk have different views; <br/>I know a person small—<br/>She keeps ten million serving-men,<br/>Who get no rest at all!<br/><br/>She sends'em abroad on her own affairs,<br/> From the second she opens her eyes—<br/>One million Hows, two million Wheres,<br/>And seven million Whys!" - Rudyard Kipling, The Elephant's Child (Just So Stories)
