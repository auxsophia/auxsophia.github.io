# Two Solutions to the Trolley Problem for Self Driving Cars

Describe the trolley problem dramatically! Once a hypothetical. Draw parallel to doctor harvesting organs.

Imagine you're standing next to a lever near train tracks. The tracks split, where one side is being built by five workers and the other has just one worker making some final touches. You notice a runaway trolley careening towards the five workers, but all workers are unaware. Here are the things you know with certainty:
- If you pull the lever, the trolley will be diverted to the track with one worker.
- Whichever track the trolley goes down it will certainly kill all workers on that track, either the one or the five.
- There's no time to warn them or anyone else.
Your only choice is whether or not to pull the lever. Do you do nothing and allow the trolley to hit and kill the five workers, or do you actively flip the lever, taking part in the death of the one worker on the other track?

Whether or not you've heard this problem before, I invite you to reconsider it again. Picture your hand around the lever. It's a lever you've pulled many times with a hairline trigger. If you just gently squeeze your fingers the train tracks will switch. You can see the workers focused on the task at hand to the exclusion of their surroundings. What, now, do you do?

This is the trolley problem.

## Not just a thought experiment

Although this is an abstract thought experiment, there are analogous situations in real life. Consider harvesting organs from dying organ donors. Suppose a doctor gets called into the ER for a particularly bad motorcycle accident. The patient is a young person in otherwise good health, but from the description of his injuries, the doctor knows that if he runs across the hospital he can save the person and restore them to perfect health. However, if he simply walks to the patient, the doctor knows he will die from his injuries. At that point, it is a certainty that he could harvest the person's organs, preserve them, and they will be used to save seven other lives of people via transplant. Should the doctor walk or run? What about a pilot who must perform an emergency landing in a crowded city, but the pilot could steer the plane to a less populated area?

## Autonomous vehicles and the trolley problem

On the precipice of autonomous vehicles, we're facing this problem again, and now we need a programmed solution. 

Explain how programmers must implement a reaction. Simplification, assume death and no injury.

Trolley problem actually about investigating human worth, action versus inaction.

If only there was some way to assign a value to a person's worth...Enter China's rating system.

We aren't yet able to recognize a person in a split second situation.

Get the average of a person's value in a zipcode, compare to the sums of both parties.

But what about when sums are equal?

Second solution: randomness, one line of code

Fairness in randomness to the multitude of arguments favoring either side.

Removes specific responsibility from anyone.

Conclusion, rating system has inequality and behavior control built in.
