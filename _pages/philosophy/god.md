# The Soul

How can we define a _soul_? One way is by substance dualism. Perhaps there's some other dimensional substance that makes up a soul.

At least some of essence, our mind, is connected and directly acted upon by the soul, or none of our mind is acted upon by any soul.

Being connected to something outside of our universe opens the door to reasoning about unreasonable possibilities, e.g. having knowledge about the world which would otherwise be impossible.
