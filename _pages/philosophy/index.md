[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) is a complex concept. I believe philosophy is a combination of thinking about thinking and thinking about how our thoughts relate to reality. The three major branches broken into three questions are
- What is reality? (_Metaphysics_)
- What is knowledge? (_Epistemology_)
- What are values? (_Value theory/Axiology_)
