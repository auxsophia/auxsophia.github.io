[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) is a complex concept. I believe philosophy is a combination of thinking about thinking and thinking about how our thoughts relate to reality. The three major branches broken into three questions are
- What is reality? (_Metaphysics_)
- What is knowledge? (_Epistemology_)
- What are values? (_Value theory/Axiology_)

Giving a small tree of philosophy:

- Metaphysics
  - Ontology
  - Philosophy of Mind
  - Philosophy of Time
- Epistemology
  - Logic
    - Critical Thinking
    - Mathematical Logic
    - Para-consistent Logic
  - Meta-philosophy
    - Meta-ethics
  - Philosophy of History
  - Philosophy of Language
  - Philosophy of Religion
  - Philosophy of Science
- Axiology
  - Aesthetics
  - Ethics
    - Applied Ethics
    - Political Philosophy

Check out a pretty cool collection of [arguments](/philosophy/arguments/). It's a project to put some of my reasoning out in the open. This can save energy if I comment on social media about common topics. I can quickly copy and tailor my arguments for that person.

### Philosophy Resources

Of course [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is still a great source.

[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)](https://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html)

[The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP)](https://www.iep.utm.edu/home/about/)
> The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) was founded in 1995 to provide open access to detailed, scholarly, peer-reviewed information on key topics and philosophers in all areas of philosophy. The Encyclopedia receives no funding, and operates through the volunteer work of the editors, authors, volunteers, and technical advisers.

For any philosophical concept I write about, if you want to dig deeper I suggest reading about the idea on [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html), and [IEP](https://www.iep.utm.edu/home/about/), then you'll be an expert ;)
