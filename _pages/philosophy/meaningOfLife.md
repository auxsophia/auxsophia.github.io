Here is my attempt to answer the question of the meaning of life.

I'm a person who's had a lot of time to think and reflect on life and my experience. I've searched for meaning my entire life. Any talk of meaning has focused my attention.

If you think the answer will bring you peace, tranquility, or happiness, then I will tell you this:

Love. Love yourself, love other people, love your work.

Accept that you are a human being with needs. Humans are driven by a lack of needs on different levels. [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) provides a list.

Which needs dominate our lives depends on our development over the life span.

Reflect on what need is missing from your life and work to satisfy it.

If you feel your needs are satisfied you should search for a state of flow.

"In positive psychology, a [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time."

Components of flow:
- Intense and focused concentration on the present moment
- Merging of action and awareness
- A loss of reflective self-consciousness
- A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
- A distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered
- Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience
- Immediate feedback
- Feeling the potential to succeed
- Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible

Flow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve a flow state:

1. One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task.
2. The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their performance to maintain the flow state.
3. One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and their own perceived skills. One must have confidence in one's ability to complete the task at hand.

Schaffer (2013) proposed seven flow conditions:

1. Knowing what to do
2. Knowing how to do it
3. Knowing how well you are doing
4. Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved)
5. High perceived challenges
6. High perceived skills
7. Freedom from distractions

I strongly recommend the book [The Happiness Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Happiness_Hypothesis) by Jonathan Haidt. The author compares the findings of modern science with the wisdom of ancient philosophies and cultures. Haidt proposes the equation for happiness as: H = S + C + V

* H = Happiness
* S = your biological set point of emotions
* C = circumstances
* V = voluntary actions

S - "The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes," [hedonic adaptation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill), "Hedonic adaptation is a process or mechanism that reduces the effective impact of emotional events. Generally, hedonic adaptation involves a happiness "set point", whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of happiness throughout their lives, despite events that occur in their environment. The process of hedonic adaptation is often conceptualized as a treadmill, since one must continually work to maintain a certain level of happiness."

Many of the things we think will make us happy will only lead to a fleeting, temporary happiness which we adapt to. Anything you are searching for that will be static and unchanging will eventually not bring you happiness. We evolved this way because content creatures often become stagnant and don't grow.

If you want to know how happy you will be you should reflect on how happy you have been. The average is likely your set point.

_If your average happiness makes you dissatisfied, don't give up yet!_

You may not have reached your true set point. Your set point is heavily influenced by your health. Focus first on [sleep](/sleep/), [nutrition](/MINDdiet/), and [exercise](/calisthenics/), in that order.

Your circumstances influence happiness and your ability to maintain your health. Some environments are toxic or don't support growth. We must make a voluntary action to change to a different set of circumstances as best we can.

We mostly need to invest work and energy into our voluntary actions to make ourselves as happy as we desire. We must choose to prioritize our health with a focus on balancing our needs in life.

Recognize and accept that happiness and well-being are not a destination to reach and rest at but must continually strive for and renew.

A short story on controlling emotions:

---

A monk asked their master how to control their own emotions. The master told the monk to go to the ocean and stop the waves from crashing. Accustomed to strange challenges, the monk faced the open ocean and tried to stop the waves by punching and kicking. The waves did break in some parts, but the monk was still pushed over and tumbled by the strong waves. Nothing the monk tried stopped the waves.

Emotions are like waves. Sometimes they are pleasant and gentle. Sometimes we can ignore them. Sometimes the waves are so powerful they threaten to destroy us.

We all have different levels of sensitivity. Some of us are in the ocean of emotion with water at our waist. Some are deeper in the ocean with turbulent and frightening currents. Some of us are not even in the water but stand far away.

In all cases we must accept the waves will come. The waves will hit us and they will recede.

With this reflection, the monk sits in the ocean and no longer attempts to break the waves. The waves wash over the monk, each one unique and different from the last. Some waves push the monk out of balance, but the monk in time returns to their position and peace. The monk cannot control the waves, but the monk has the most influence over their reaction.

The work of [Shaolin Master Shi Heng Yi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-079YIasck) provides a guide on self-mastery:

### 5 Hindrances to Self-Mastery

1. Sensual desire (sight/touch/taste/smell/hearing) = Am I distracted or addicted?
2. Ill will / aversion = Am I feeling a negative emotion?
3. Dullness / heaviness = Am I unmotivated?
4. Restlessness = Is my mind jumping from thought to thought?
5. Skeptical doubt = Am I indecisive?

### RAIN

- Recognize which hindrance you're experiencing
- Accept what you're experiencing
- Investigate why you're experiencing the hindrance
- Non-identify with the experience: 'I am not the body, I am not the mind, I am not my emotion'

### Loving Yourself and Others

How can you learn to love yourself and others?

The information surrounding relationships is so powerful I hesitate to share it, because it can cause as much harm as it can good. However, the tools of relationships are critical for a full and healthy human life.

I will propose three parts to satisfying relationships based on social engineering which you can use to reflect on your past relationships. Your most cherished relationships will often involve:

1. Trust
2. Empathy
3. Rationality

You must trust the other person. You should be able to accurately predict how they will react. That person should have the ability to understand the emotional content of your experience. You should trust the other person to be rational, to make appropriate choices given enough information. Do your best relationships have these characteristics?

Learning to love yourself is much like building a deep relationship with another person. You should demonstrate your trustworthiness, display empathy, and be rational. Do you trust yourself? Do you keep your personal promises and commitments? Are you consistent in your behavior? Are you empathetic and understanding with your emotions? Do you forgive yourself for past actions? How often do you check in and assess how you are feeling? Are you rational and make the right choices given what you know? Do you fall into impulses and easy routines?

To love yourself, treat yourself as a friend. Invest in yourself. Make a commitment to your emotional health then follow up later. You will build trust and empathy in yourself. Invest in your rationality. Take time to explore all of your options. First determine what is best then assess how able you are to reach the best outcome. Try to be objective and fair. Recognize your judgment of yourself and others is likely at least 10% inaccurate. With doubt cut yourself and others slack for failures, but work towards overcoming those obstacles in the future.

If this is so clear, why is it rare or difficult? Loving yourself and others takes work, energy, and investment. Relationships and selves are highly complex. Forces outside of our control will eventually disrupt our bonds. When that happens we can do our best to repair and reinforce our relationships.

If you find this answer satisfying, I suggest you stop now. I wish you a good life.

# The Meaning of Life

As for the truest, most objective, most accurate description of reality and the meaning of life, before I continue I would sincerely like you to consider that it may shake you to your core. As I will explain, the average person is full of delusions and lives on the basis of ignorance and lies. They are productive lies, but inaccurate to the truest description of reality. You will likely be unable to return to your previous mode of thinking. As you might expect, the answer is complex and incomplete. Give up expectation on how you think you will react.

### The Island of Reality

When I speak of reality, I divide our experience into three parts, objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. To explain the divisions, imagine an island in the ocean, small and big enough for one person. However, there are no humans or animals on the island. We can describe and talk about what is there even though we can imagine no humans there to use language to describe it. We can talk of grains of sand, the ocean waves, the plants. Whatever we can discuss without involving a human being existing there is objective reality. I believe the world and universe continues to exist even if we aren't around to experience it. Now the subjective experience is when a human being appears on the island.

Let's imagine one person. One person on the island is another part of objective reality. We are a part of objective reality, a complex part. We have feelings, memories, thoughts, and all kinds of phenomena when we're awake. There's something it's like to see the color of a ripe mango. There's something it's like to lay on the sand and feel the warmth of the sun. We can describe these experiences objectively, measuring the frequency and amplitude of the light coming from the mango and into an eye, following the chain reaction through the brain and body. Given the objective facts, we still have something missing from the description, the "what it's like-ness" of our personal experience. Whatever we imagine and talk about that requires at least one person, that's subjective reality on top of objective reality. However, subjective experience is in the space of minds which apparently have different qualities than most of objective reality. The space of ideas is as diverse as we can feel and communicate.

Whatever phenomena requires two or more people, that is inter-subjective reality. Most of language is an inter-subjective reality. Words have meaning not in themselves but in the context of the mind experiencing the words. It seems most of language is about communicating on a complex level about objective and subjective reality with other similarly complex creatures. We talk about what we experience (objective) and what we're feeling (subjective). So complex communication creates a pattern of behavior. A pattern of behavior being an event we experience and predict with regularity. Two people can agree on an idea, like money. Even on an island, two people can agree blue sea shells are equal in value to one mango. If one gives the other a blue shell, the other agrees to give a mango.

Consider the standard currency of America, the $1 bill. Imagine this bill alone on an island with no people. Does it possess any value or effect on its own? What is the objective description of the money? It is a rectangular piece of rare paper with ink designs bonded to the surface. After sometime it will disintegrate like all wood and paper. What about with the bill and one person on the island? Now something else is happening, the person is perceiving the bill. There's subjective phenomena occurring with whatever the person experiences. Now think of the phenomena when two people on the island exchange the bill for other things. We live in a world where millions and billions of humans agree on a shared experience and perception of reality. Now the rectangular piece of paper with special ink designs can cause so many events, freedom, food, shelter, violence, destruction, and everything money involves. Money is a part of reality, but it is almost a life separate from objective reality. The value of money is in our minds and carried out in our behavior.

As we have described money on an analysis of three levels of reality, we can split our memories and experience into an analysis by three parts. Investigations into the three parts of experience in science are described by:

- Objective reality
  - Physics giving rise to chemistry giving rise to biology

- Subjective reality
  - Cognition and psychology arising from biology.

- Inter-subjective
  - Psychology giving rise to mass psychology, sociology, and the social sciences

So we can analyze experience on each level of reality. With gender, there is an objective level at which we can categorize creatures. Let's discuss human beings. Men and women have differently shaped bodies and expressions. Our DNA can be categorized as XX and XY. Many things are independent of what we individually and collectively think or feel. There is also a subjective sense of gender, what we believe we should or should not do. The brain reacts and operates differently depending on the hormone balance in the body, causing a change in its function. How our subjective sense expresses itself is often a function of the social level, inter-subjectivity. There are patterns of behavior accepted as masculine or feminine, and these change across time and cultures. Notice that if we were to compare a woman from 10,000 years ago with a woman of modern times, biologically we will see many similarities in hormone profile, shape, etc. However, the culture has changed dramatically. Even in modern times, one country to another can have great dissimilarity. However, biological sex exists on the objective level, sexual and gender identity exists on the subjective level (on top of the objective level), and gender norms exist on the inter-subjective level.

Looking at money, much of what money is and how it effects change in the world is not on the objective level. The value of money tracks in the beliefs and behaviors of humans.

How did objective reality come to be? How did life start? These are difficult questions. For an individual, we are limited by our personal experience and subjectivity. We experience the world through our own senses. If the average human lifetime is 50 years, how can we soundly infer what has happened before us and what will happen after?

To simplify the question, let's start with very basic rules for a "universe."

[<img src="../../images/gameoflife.png" width="100%" height="100%">](https://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/game-of-life/)

Imagine the above grid spread out in all directions. Each square represents either a living cell or a dead spot. Let's say the white parts are dead, and the black parts are living cells. The way the grid starts at moment zero, the beginning of the universe, is randomly assigned. Some cells will be alive and some will be dead. Now, [here are the rules of this basic universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):

1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

With every "tick," every moment after the start, the rules are applied to each cell on the grid at the current moment. Please take a moment to apply these rules to the grid above.

Of course, we can get a computer to calculate these rules on a much larger grid. From these three rules, what do you expect to see? Really try to imagine the possibilities. How much will the living cells spread and move? With there be something like groups of cells moving across the grid? Can we make a stable formation that will never change or die? What's a weird looking group that could pop up? Will the grid just be flashing lights of cells popping in and out with no forms?

The answer isn't obvious to me. The easier way to know what will happen is to run the simulation and see what we get. Some people have let the simulation run for days on a vast grid and cataloged what happens.

[Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns)

There was never a specific design for any of these patterns. They occur from the initial state and the rules on that state. The results are fascinating as "creatures," groups of connected cells, interact with each other. There are self-replicating creatures which create new groups of cells which are sent off.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="../../images/Gospers_glider_gun.gif" width="50%" height="50%">
<br>A pattern called Gosper's glider gun.
{: refdef}

Do you think a computer could arise from these three simple rules? In fact, a computer can arise without intervention or design, a Turing machine. Conway's game of life is Turing complete, and can simulate any Turing machine. This means any algorithm can be carried out by a complex enough group of cells in the game. So groups of cells can self-replicate and carry out programs, processing information, all from three simple rules.

A large part of this demonstration is to show what properties can arise from simple operations. I didn't expect to see so many incredible patterns. Consider the universe we inhabit. What are the basic rules that govern this universe? [Here's a list of fundamental physics formulas.](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Fundamental_Physics/Formulas)

Instead of a few basic rules, humans have discovered many laws governing the transfer of energy, heat, motion, etc. We could hardly predict what would come about from three simple rules, so what can we expect from hundreds of laws interacting? Our ideas of cells were extremely simple, alive or dead, yet the biology of our lives are extremely complex. Physics gives rise to all the elements on the periodic table with their interactions.

To gain an understanding of life and the world, we need an understanding of [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics). "Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat and temperature, and their relation to energy, work, radiation, and properties of matter. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics," ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics)).

"The three [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics) define physical quantities (temperature, energy, and entropy) that characterize thermodynamic systems at thermodynamic equilibrium. The laws describe how these quantities behave under various circumstances, and preclude the possibility of certain phenomena (such as perpetual motion)."

"The **first law of thermodynamics** is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems.

The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed...

The First Law encompasses several principles:

- The law of conservation of energy.
- The concept of internal energy and its relationship to temperature.
- Work is a process of transferring energy to or from a system in ways that can be described by macroscopic mechanical forces exerted by factors in the surroundings, outside the system.
- When matter is transferred into a system, that masses' associated internal energy and potential energy are transferred with it.
- The flow of heat is a form of energy transfer. Heating is a natural process of moving energy to or from a system other than by work or the transfer of matter. Direct passage of heat is only from a hotter to a colder system.

Combining these principles leads to one traditional statement of the first law of thermodynamics: it is not possible to construct a machine which will perpetually output work without an equal amount of energy input to that machine. Or more briefly, a perpetual motion machine of the first kind is impossible."

"The **second law of thermodynamics** indicates the irreversibility of natural processes, and, in many cases, the tendency of natural processes to lead towards spatial homogeneity of matter and energy, and especially of temperature. It can be formulated in a variety of interesting and important ways.

It implies the existence of a quantity called the entropy of a thermodynamic system. In terms of this quantity it implies that

_When two initially isolated systems in separate but nearby regions of space, each in thermodynamic equilibrium with itself but not necessarily with each other, are then allowed to interact, they will eventually reach a mutual thermodynamic equilibrium. The sum of the entropies of the initially isolated systems is less than or equal to the total entropy of the final combination. Equality occurs just when the two original systems have all their respective intensive variables (temperature, pressure) equal; then the final system also has the same values._

The second law is applicable to a wide variety of processes, reversible and irreversible. All natural processes are irreversible. Reversible processes are a useful and convenient theoretical fiction, but do not occur in nature...

Entropy may also be viewed as a physical measure of the lack of physical information about the microscopic details of the motion and configuration of a system, when only the macroscopic states are known. This lack of information is often described as disorder on a microscopic or molecular scale. The law asserts that for two given macroscopically specified states of a system, there is a quantity called the difference of information entropy between them. This information entropy difference defines how much additional microscopic physical information is needed to specify one of the macroscopically specified states, given the macroscopic specification of the other – often a conveniently chosen reference state which may be presupposed to exist rather than explicitly stated. A final condition of a natural process always contains microscopically specifiable effects which are not fully and exactly predictable from the macroscopic specification of the initial condition of the process. This is why entropy increases in natural processes – the increase tells how much extra microscopic information is needed to distinguish the final macroscopically specified state from the initial macroscopically specified state."

"The **third law of thermodynamics** is sometimes stated as follows:

_The entropy of a perfect crystal of any pure substance approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero._

At zero temperature the system must be in a state with the minimum thermal energy. This statement holds true if the perfect crystal has only one state with minimum energy...

_The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches zero._"

"The zeroth law of thermodynamics may be stated in the following form:

_If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other._

The law is intended to allow the existence of an empirical parameter, the temperature, as a property of a system such that systems in thermal equilibrium with each other have the same temperature."

Life can be extensively explained from the implications of these laws.

I am strongly influenced by Professor Sid Smith's lecture, [How to Enjoy the End of the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WPB2u8EzL8&t=745s) published on Apr 23, 2019.

This lecture had a profound effect on me because of the mathematical and intuitive explanation. He analyzes organisms, societies, and planets based on physics models of energy.

Understanding [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) is critical to understanding the world.

"In statistical mechanics, entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system. It is closely related to the number Ω of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number Ω of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume...

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like organisms, may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, total entropy in the Universe does increase. Entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is reversible, the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.

Because it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it."

A dissipative structure is embodied energy that takes in exergy (low entropy energy) and expels heat (high entropy energy), according to the arrow of time (tending towards entropy). For instance, a fire is a dissipative structure. The fire uses fuel (exergy) to maintain and grow until the fuel is used. Once the fuel is gone, all exergy has been released as heat. The energy is the same, but the exergy is gone. "One can view the entire universe as a dissipative structure. The big bang released exergy, creating time and space. The feature that is perhaps most characteristic of dissipative structure, including the universe itself, is complexity."

Complexity appears to defy the second law of physics, which is in a closed system entropy will always increase. "Order is never spontaneously produced from disorder. Once a glass breaks, you can't un-break it." Every dissipative structure converts exergy to heat, but it does so based on the rules of energy transfer and the dissipative structure itself.

### We are like fire.

Living creatures are dissipative structures. We are not unlike a fire which consumes all available fuel to expand and maintain itself until there is no more fuel. The fuel needed for life is simply more complex. We require many different kinds of fuel, food, typically other complex dissipative structures like plants and animals, to maintain and grow our own structures, our bodies. The way heat and energy are dissipated from our body is governed by physics and biology, where biology is the study of living dissipative structures. Fire doesn't appear to consciously direct itself just like we don't decide how to sweat or where our blood vessels should grow. Our bodies emerged from a long evolutionary process. Evolutionary processes selected for the rules which govern our bodies, and we need an understanding of evolution to understand life.

Just like how complex patterns emerged in Conway's game of life, so too did life emerge as a complex pattern from an initial state. Do the patterns we see moving across the grid decide which way they go? No, it's clearly an outcome determined by the rules of the game. The story of our life is similar.

### Properties of Dissipative Structures

- All dissipative structures consume exergy, transforming useful energy into less useful energy.

- All dissipative structures give rise to complexity (i.e., they are self-organizing) as an emergent property of the way their inherent rules channel their energy flows.

- No dissipative structure is immortal

Crises can disrupt homeostasis. The more complex a system is the more possibility of a crisis occurring as well a crisis causing a cascade of further crises ultimately unraveling homeostasis.

Assuming a dissipative structure has access to unlimited exergy and no crises, can it go on forever?

"In general no, because they are never static and never go backwards. No natural process is reversible in itself, because entropy always increases, never spontaneously decreases. The same processes that brought a dissipative structure must continue, because energy must continue to flow, increasing complexity. Each increase in complexity has a metabolic cost. As these costs accumulate, eventually the system becomes unsustainable on its energy base and increasingly fragile. At some point, a crisis occurs and there's a complexity collapse. If exergy is still available post-collapse, new dissipative structures will arise anew, typically with significant differences from the old structure."

The biologist [Eugene Odom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Odum) describes this process in ecosystems called ecological succession. Ecosystem means a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. An ecosystem begins on pure rock with small and simple dissipative structures. Eventually the entire ecosystem collapses and ends. A new ecosystem is built on a previous ecosystem. Each community of organisms in the ecosystem alters the environment. "It culminates in a homeostatic ecosystem in which biomass and symbiotic function between organisms are maintained. Maximum that is per unit of energy flow. Nature always optimizes. To repeat, self-organization is directed towards achieving as large and diverse a dissipative structure within the limits set by the available energy input and the prevailing physical conditions. Once homeostasis is achieved, the ecosystem is mature. However, eventually the ecosystem succumbs to its own fragility. A small perturbation in climate, or a fire, or an evolution of a disruptive, invasive, or parasitic species, and all the intricate specializations that lead to the optimization of the structure become in turn the cause of the system's failures. In the long view, this is not a tragedy, but an essential component of the evolutionary process. It's precisely the story of life on this planet with its breathtaking diversity not only across continents, but across time."

Eventually, every organism relies on the whole system to survive. Once the system dies, the individuals die as well. In a similar way to how a fire will burn available fuel, organisms and ecosystems adapt to consume available fuel (exergy), specializing in the process of transforming that useful energy into less useful energy.

Sapiens begins at the big bang and fast forwards through time to about 2.5 million years ago where it traces homo erectus and the many cousin-species of homo sapiens. What is so impactful to me about this book is how it breaks down the long held hubris of humankind. **"They [humans] were insignificant animals, whose ecological impact was less than that of fireflies or jellyfish."** With homo sapiens appearing just 0.2 million years ago, we likely held a niche spot in the ecosystem similar to the woodpecker. Just like the woodpecker evolved to eat grubs by hammering through dense bark, we might have evolved to eat bone marrow. When an apex predator such as a tiger killed a giraffe, early humans watched as the tiger and pride ate most of the giraffe. Then the hyenas came to eat the remaining parts. Finally, early humans, after looking all around for predators, slunk towards the carcass to eat any remaining tissue and use stone tools to break bones and eat the marrow. That was our niche.

However, for 2 million years from homo erectus to homo sapiens, our brains just kept growing. We are still unsure as the reason why. With the domestication of fire, humans could scare away beasts, keep themselves warm, cook food, and control their environment. One human could easily burn down a forest in a matter of 20 minutes. How did humans control themselves not to destroy everything? Humans learned to do controlled burning which allowed them to pick through charred meat and other foods in the aftermath of a fire.

Of course, cooking food allowed our bodies to absorb the nutrients better. This hints at what was to come, humans getting more resources from the same amount of food or land when compared to other species.

What makes humans so unique is our ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Other swarm and hive creatures cooperate in large numbers, but they all follow simple rules. Humans can learn new rules and collectively change their behaviors. The accumulation of knowledge in various subjects and the depths explored lead me to believe we can give a more detailed and accurate answer to the meaning of life than ever before.

Returning to Professor Smith's lecture:

### What about civilization as dissipative structures?

Energy Return on Investment (EROI)

EROI = (total energy acquired) / energy spent to acquire energy

EROI for most creatures is between 1 and 2. An EROI less than 1 is starvation. An EROI towards 2 means growth.

The EROI of hunter-gatherer societies is roughly 1.5. Just enough to form kinship groups, reproduction, and the fastening of a few tools and decorations. The cultural complexity can be impressive, but the social connections are necessarily limited.

Social connections tend to track closely with EROI. Agricultural settlements tend to have an EROI of 4, allowing specializations within the societies not directly related to energy gathering. Complex tools could be developed. Stored food also helps to preserve energy.

Communities tended to over-exploit an agricultural area resulting in reduced yields over time, reducing EROI. Second, successful communities were an inviting target for raiders. This contributed to a second leap in complexity to agriculture-based empires. These empires tend to have an EROI of 6. Empires tend to have a boost in EROI after conquering other settlements, either over-exploiting them or continuing to slowly extract resources. This created highly complex hierarchies and specializations.

However, after all surrounding settlements are conquered they must be administered and garrisoned, taking energy. Diminishing returns set in with settlements being further apart and EROI declines. To combat a declining EROI, taxes tend to increase on agricultural outputs and inexorably leads to resource depletion. Finally, the weakened empire is conquered or falls to pieces.

Example, Rome. The Ancient Roman Empire was especially good at running an empire. Conquest temporarily increased EROI by a factor of 2, but each attempt they made to maintain increased the cost of homeostasis. Only excessive taxation could maintain the metabolic cost of empire. Resource depletion (including human resources) eventually led to permanently declining EROI and complexity (including economic, social, and political/administrative) collapse.

---

Humans occupy a strange place in the ecosystem. We are creatures that have multiplied our EROI's beyond the standard range of [0,2]. Fossil fuels are like batteries which have been slowly charged by the sun over thousands of years.

### We are like water.

Water is an excellent heat conductor. Since we are a slow but dynamic burning fire, we need a way for our body to expel heat (thermal energy) less we burn up too quickly and lose homeostasis to maintain our form in working order. Water saps the heat away from our bodies by changing its state. Water can leave our body through sweating. The sweat beads on our skin and eventually absorbs enough thermal energy that the sweat changes from a liquid state into a gaseous state, evaporating on the skin. Water is how we measure temperature in Celsius. [Under normal atmospheric conditions, water is solid (ice) at 0 degrees Celsius, water vapor at 100 degrees Celsius, and liquid in between](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/rocket/state.html).

"In physics, a state of matter is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as liquid crystal, and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as Bose–Einstein condensates, neutron-degenerate matter, and quark–gluon plasma, which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high energy. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the list of states of matter.

Historically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties. Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles (atoms, molecules or ions) close together and fixed into place. Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container. Its particles are still close together but move freely. Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container. Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place. Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.

The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter." [State of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter)

Every element has a range of temperatures at which it's in a solid state. Passed a melting point, a liquid state. Passed a boiling point, a gas. Finally, a plasma state like the surface of the Sun with electromagnetic properties. There are other states of matter, but these are the ones we typically interact with and categorize as daily reality.

We humans studied these states, but if we think of the island concept to isolate objective reality, what is this constant state of change? On an island with no life, no complex structures, the ocean waves crash against the shore. To describe the location objectively, different elements and molecules in different states of matter are interacting and exchanging energy flows according to the laws of thermodynamics and physics. All living things which we see around us today came from those early times of our planet's life.

### We are an incredibly complex game of life left on for roughly 3.8 billion years.

Our planet Earth exists in perfect distance from the Sun to allow for complex life structures to arise. The energy from the Sun is like cooking over a fire. The heat is hottest closest and coldest farther away. To cook just right you need the right distance. Too cold and we're frozen where there's not enough changes in matter. Too hot the energy present is so high nothing solid can form. We are in a space that allows for many states and in a time of homeostasis. There are so many qualities of the universe and our solar system which are in a delicate balance to bring about life.

### [The Earth is an open and closed system](https://course.oeru.org/csf101/learning-pathways/from-the-holocene-to-the-anthropocene/the-earth-is-an-open-and-closed-system/)

#### The Earth is a closed system for matter
The Earth is made up of chemical elements – think of the periodic table.  That is a list of all basic elemental materials on our planet.  Because of gravity, matter (comprising all solids, liquids and gases) does not leave the system.  It is a closed box.  And, the laws of thermodynamics, long agreed by scientists, tell us that it’s impossible to destroy matter.  So the chemical matter we have on Earth will always be here.  The important question is, how are those chemicals organised?

#### The Earth is an open system for energy
It is accepted science that the Earth is an open system for energy.  Energy radiates into the Earth’s system, mainly from the sun.  Energy is then radiated back into space from the Earth, with the flows being regulated by the Earth’s atmosphere and ozone layer.  This delicate balanced transfer of energy maintains the surface temperature at a level that is suited to the forms of life that have evolved and currently exist.

Scientists say there is no life on Mars, our neighboring planet. There are storms on the surface with tornadoes the size of states and countries here on Earth. Thunderstorms, lightning strikes, and sand cutting through the air at high kilometers per hour. Earth allows for a steadier stream and flow of energy states that allow for complex structures.

Our bodies evolved to be formed of "Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium. All 11 are necessary for life. The remaining elements are trace elements, of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary for life. All of the mass of the trace elements put together (less than 10 grams for a human body) do not add up to the body mass of magnesium, the least common of the 11 non-trace elements...Most of the elements needed for life are relatively common in the Earth's crust.," [Composition of the human body
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body).

"Carbon is a primary component of all known life on Earth, representing approximately 45–50% of all dry biomass. Carbon compounds occur naturally in great abundance on Earth. Complex biological molecules almost always consist of carbon atoms bonded with other elements, especially oxygen and hydrogen and frequently also nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur...Carbon is capable of forming a vast number of compounds, more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date, and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements". The enormous diversity of carbon-containing compounds, known as organic compounds, has led to a distinction between them and compounds that do not contain carbon, known as inorganic compounds. The branch of chemistry that studies organic compounds is known as organic chemistry.

Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's widespread abundance, its ability to form stable bonds with numerous other elements, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables it to serve as a common element of all known living organisms." [Carbon-based life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life)

We are roughly 70% water. The next time you hold a glass of water, consider what would be left of you if all the water was separated from your body. You would most certainly stop living. Water is essential to the function of our bodies. We would shrivel up to only 30% of our body weight. You would be a dried husk. Looking at the glass of water, how does it create all the wonder of life we experience? What of the carbon that remains? Does this substance hold the secret of living experience? But carbon by itself doesn't appear to hold the spark of life.

The organization and structure of the elements gives rise to our conscious experience. The dynamic pattern of the flow of water, matter, and energy through, in, and around our bodies is the spark of life. A disruption of the structure of our bodies can cause a terminal crisis or trauma. A traumatic brain injury disorganizes the structure of our important organ, disconnecting the knowledge and function developed.

### Is the meaning of life simply to burn?

Like the universe is a dissipative structure, transforming energy through entropy, are we a miniature version of it? We are like the crackling sparks of a fire. Our lives are so short in comparison to the sun and cosmos, a brief and fleeting flame. Enough of life sparks a new flame for life to persist through time by having children, progeny. Child birth is like a fire whose heat sparks a fire in something near to it, sometimes by touching, sometimes simply by being hot enough. A new flame starts and the original flame dies. No flame burns forever. Even the stars will die.

What is likely to become of the future of our planet, life, and the universe? I highly recommend [TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A Journey to the End of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA). The universe is projected to have [5 eras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Ages_of_the_Universe), the Primordial, Stelliferous, Degenerate, Black Hole, and Dark eras. We currently live in the Stelliferous. "In addition to explaining current cosmological theory, the authors speculate on what kinds of life might exist in future eras of the universe. The speculation is based on a scaling hypothesis, credited to Freeman Dyson, the idea being, that all other things being equal the rate of metabolism—and therefore rate of consciousness—of an organism should be in direct proportion to the temperature at which that organism thrives," [The Five Ages of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Ages_of_the_Universe).

For more on what's expected, see the [Timeline of the far future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future):

"While the future can never be predicted with absolute certainty, present understanding in various scientific fields allows for the prediction of some far-future events, if only in the broadest outline. These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.

All projections of the future of Earth, the Solar System, and the universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must rise over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters between astronomical objects gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.

Physicists expect that matter itself will eventually come under the influence of radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.

The timelines displayed here cover events from the beginning of the 11th millennium to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternative future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans will become extinct, whether protons decay, and whether the Earth survives when the Sun expands to become a red giant."

### Returning to the self

We live on the surface of a water planet tuned to just the right energy levels to allow for an extremely complex change in matter and energy resulting in the observable universe. The constant, ongoing change we call life our blips of energy from one state of energy to another state. Change, information, is a measure of entropy which is the change from moments and times before.

Renee Descartes was a philosopher who took doubt to an extreme. He locked himself in a room and systematically questioned his most basic beliefs. He didn't have as advanced physics and explanations for phenomena as we do today, so he believed in a top down approach to an explanation of reality. Like a good tool is created by an intelligent agent, a human with technical skill, Descartes believed as many enlightened people of the day did, an intelligent designer created the observable universe. The complexity of animals, plants, the sky, and everything is so great, the intelligent designer must be greater in complexity still. To craft a boat and paddle takes an experienced human. To craft a universe must be in some proportion greater. God is an intelligent agent who is all good, all knowing, and all powerful. God designed everything.

This is the opposite of the explanation of particle physics which emerges from the most basic units of information up. With the idea of god, Descartes still has doubt about what he can know about his own experience. Things like candles and fire change shape and change how they effect the senses. Candles change in smell and touch. Change leads to defied expectations. Descartes was in a boat with the paddle in the water. The water refracts light, making the sight of the paddle look distorted and wavy. The paddle looked to be a third of a meter long but when pulled out of the water is clearly a meter long and solid. If his sense of sight can be so easily distorted under certain conditions, what about all of his senses? What about the times where all of reality can be distorted, sleeps full of dreams. In a dream, structures and changes we never see in waking life appear real to us for a short time. Upon waking, we realize the dream was not a part of our daily experience. In the moment of the dream, we should be doubting what we experience.

Although in a dream we should doubt all sensory experience, Descartes believed we didn't have reason to doubt mathematical truths. 2 + 2 = 4 whether you are dreaming or not. However, many parts of dreams gives us false confidence in beliefs. What if god is at least not all good. What if god is malevolent and wants to confuse us. God could create a world or a mind in which we are deceived on the most fundamental levels. God could make us believe god is all good with certainty. We could believe that 2 + 2 = 5 with the feeling of absolute certainty. Is there any claim which we cannot doubt?

The only claim Descartes believed to be beyond doubt is that even if we are being deceived, there is a thinking thing, our mind or soul, which is being deceived. In the original Latin, this is _cogito ergo sum_, I think therefore I am. Descartes was confident that he existed.

A later linguist and philosopher, Nietzsche, cast doubt on the _cogito_ claim. Consider the statement 'it is raining.' What is the 'it' which is raining? Is 'it' the clouds? In language, subjects are inferred. Rain and rain drops spontaneously appear. There is no subject that causes or creates the rain. Analogously, perhaps there is no 'I' in _I think therefore I am_; perhaps there is only thinking like there is only raining.

Thus we arrive at the only claim beyond doubt, the only statement we can be certain of: we are at least **a momentary blip of consciousness**.

There is some theoretical backing to these ideas of blips of consciousness.

"The [Boltzmann brain argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain) suggests that it is more likely for a single brain to spontaneously and briefly form in a void (complete with a false memory of having existed in our universe) than it is for our universe to have come about in the way modern science thinks it actually did. It was first proposed as a reductio ad absurdum response to Ludwig Boltzmann's early explanation for the low-entropy state of our universe.

In this physics thought experiment, a Boltzmann brain is a fully formed brain, complete with memories of a full human life in our universe, that arises due to extremely rare random fluctuations out of a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Theoretically over a period of time on the order of hundreds of billions of years, by sheer chance atoms in a void could spontaneously come together in such a way as to assemble a functioning human brain. Like any brain in such circumstances, it would almost immediately stop functioning and begin to deteriorate."

Another way of thinking of randomness is to imagine a small image of 32x32 pixels. For simplicity, the pixels are either white or black, on or off, at random. How long would it take for the number 1 to form in the image? Only the pixels showing the 1 would be white. Of course, there are many images that look like white noise, just random white and black dots with no order, but after some time, the 1 will appear recognizable. Given enough time, every possible image that can be constructed out of those pixels will appear. This is similar to how reality is said to pop into existence.

"Bertrand Russell wrote, in The Analysis of Mind: "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past." - [Omphalos hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos_hypothesis#A_deceptive_creator)

How do we know the universe didn't pop into existence in its current form 5 minutes ago? We might have all of the memories, but those popped into existence when we did too. I can think of no way around this idea, because the point of the thought experiment is that all experience and knowledge outside of the present moment is cut off. If we look to the future to perform some experiment or verify continued existence, the reply is that the present is when we were created.

So what can we derive, what more can we know with the certain truth that we are a momentary blip of consciousness?

Here lies the problem of removing all certainty. Descartes was attempting to form a foundation for further beliefs. If we can have a fundamental belief that is known to be absolutely true and a set of rules which are guaranteed to result in a justified and true belief, then we can have a set of true and justified beliefs beyond doubt. This is the axiomatic approach.

What else can you know based on the statement that existence is at least a momentary blip of consciousness?

For a meaning of life, I want to be certain and justified in the meaning.

[Agrippa’s Trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma) is the culmination of [ancient skepticism on justification](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-ancient/#AgrFivMod). In order to have certainty and knowledge, we believe some type of justification must be given. Agrippa’s Trilemma aims to show the failure of justification, and therefore that certainty is unachievable.

The position is that justification is based on three main types:
1. Assumption - Some premises are assumed to be true, typically they are accepted to be self-evident. This rests on an assumption, which does not give us certainty.
2. Infinite regress - Each claim must be supported by another claim, and that supporting claim must in turn be supported by another claim. The third supporting claim must also be supported, _ad infinitum_. Since we must ultimately stop on an unsupported claim, we can never be certain that we have proper support of our claims.
3. Circularity - Instead of an infinite regress, we find that claims support each other in some kind of circular fashion. However, this is widely regarded as a fallacious way of reasoning.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

This analysis of justification is top-down instead of bottom-up. We should look closer on how justification evolves.

The ancient Greek philosopher Plato wrote that enlightenment of the mind is like quick illumination of the eyes. When entering a brilliant area our eyes hurt and need to adjust. Similarly, illumination of the mind is painful and takes adjustment.

A summary of one of Plato's famous stories, the [allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave).

---

#### Imprisonment in the cave
Plato begins by having Socrates ask Glaucon to imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood (important to note that they were (based on text) imprisoned from childhood but not from birth). These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not look around at the cave, each other, or themselves (514a–b). Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets "of men and other living things" (514b). The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do ("just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets" (514a)[3]). The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows (514c).

Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see (514b–515a).

The fire, or human made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. This can be compared to how illusions are made with light and sound today, with electronics, videos, movies, and 3D visuals. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.

Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light.

#### Departure from the cave
Plato then supposes that one prisoner is freed. This prisoner would look around and see the fire. The light would hurt his eyes and make it difficult for him to see the objects casting the shadows. If he were told that what he is seeing is real instead of the other version of reality he sees on the wall, he would not believe it. In his pain, Plato continues, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to what he is accustomed to (that is, the shadows of the carried objects). He writes "... it would hurt his eyes, and he would escape by turning away to the things which he was able to look at, and these he would believe to be clearer than what was being shown to him."

Plato continues: "Suppose... that someone should drag him... by force, up the rough ascent, the steep way up, and never stop until he could drag him out into the light of the sun." The prisoner would be angry and in pain, and this would only worsen when the radiant light of the sun overwhelms his eyes and blinds him.

"Slowly, his eyes adjust to the light of the sun. First he can only see shadows. Gradually he can see the reflections of people and things in water and then later see the people and things themselves. Eventually, he is able to look at the stars and moon at night until finally he can look upon the sun itself (516a)." Only after he can look straight at the sun "is he able to reason about it" and what it is (516b). (See also Plato's analogy of the sun, which occurs near the end of The Republic, Book VI.[4][5])

####  Return to the cave
Plato continues, saying the freed prisoner would think that the world outside the cave was superior to the world he experienced in the cave and attempt to share this with the prisoners remaining in the cave attempting to bring them onto the journey he had just endured; "he would bless himself for the change, and pity [the other prisoners]" and would want to bring his fellow cave dwellers out of the cave and into the sunlight (516c).

The returning prisoner, whose eyes have become accustomed to the sunlight, would be blind when he re-enters the cave, just as he was when he was first exposed to the sun (516e). The prisoners, according to Plato, would infer from the returning man's blindness that the journey out of the cave had harmed him and that they should not undertake a similar journey. Plato concludes that the prisoners, if they were able, would therefore reach out and kill anyone who attempted to drag them out of the cave (517a).

---

Plato remains relevant more than 2,500 years after his death because his stories by analogy apply to so many ideas. We are all living in a cave, and most of that cave is our skull. Our head encases our brain, the most complex organ or object in the observable universe. There are holes for sense organs to communicate with the brain, our eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. Our sense of touch travels from all over our body and especially through the spinal cord.

Consider hearing:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="../../images/Hearing_mechanics_cropped.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
{: refdef}

Sound must travel through a medium, air. The vibrating air moves tiny hairs inside our ears as well as vibrating a small bone in our inner ear, amplifying the sound. Our brain has dedicated areas to make sense of the sound for more information. What is the source of the sound? Where is its potential location? Our brain attempts to understand, predict, and find meaning in the vibration of the air.

Consider the question: [If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest)



Our brain receives data, bits of information, about the outside world through its sense organs. Consider sight, we see using our eyes. Our eyes are sensors that can detect a narrow width of the energy spectrum. Some creatures see far with clarity, others near sighted, some see better under water or at night. The sense data we receive is processed in our brains. We refine our understanding of the world based on incoming data and our interaction.

We have a hypothesis generated in our brains to fit the data we store in memory. What's the process for refining our prediction based on past information and new, incoming information? The ideas were formally developed by Thomas Bayes. With [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference), we can reduce learning and prediction to calculation. Bayesian inference provides a method for inferring unobserved phenomena.

## Epistemology

“Critical rationalism is an epistemological philosophy advanced by Karl Popper...Critical rationalism rejects the classical position that knowledge is justified true belief; it instead holds the exact opposite: That, in general, knowledge is unjustified untrue unbelief. It is unjustified because of the non-existence of good reasons. It is untrue, because it usually contains errors that sometimes remain unnoticed for hundreds of years. And it is not belief either, because scientific knowledge, or the knowledge needed to build a plane, is contained in no single person's mind. It is only available as the content of books.” [Critical Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism)

“Critical rationalists hold that scientific theories and any other claims to knowledge can and should be rationally criticized, and (if they have empirical content) can and should be subjected to tests which may falsify them.”

“If [claims to knowledge are] retained, further differentiation may be made on the basis of how much subjection to criticism they have received, how severe such criticism has been, and how probable the theory is, with the least probable theory that still withstands attempts to falsify it being the one to be preferred.”

With verificationism, our intuition is to have the most probable, most corroborated theory. However, Karl Popper and David Miller propose criticisms of justificationism and positivism.

1. Doubts the naive empiricism of induction based on the critical arguments of David Hume. “According to the critical rationalist, if there is a sense in which humans accrue knowledge positively by experience, it is only by pivoting observations off existing conjectural theories pertinent to the observations, or off underlying cognitive schemas which unconsciously handle perceptions and use them to generate new theories...The myth that we induce theories from particulars is persistent because when we do this we are often successful, but this is due to the advanced state of our evolved tendencies. If we were really "inducting" theories from particulars, it would be inductively logical to claim that the sun sets because I get up in the morning, or that all buses must have drivers in them (if you've never seen an empty bus).”

2. “Popper and David Miller showed in 1983 that evidence supposed to partly support a hypothesis can, in fact, only be neutral to, or even be counter-supportive of the hypothesis.” - A proof of the impossibility of inductive probability

Consider the claim: “All swans are white.”

To confirm this hypothesis, we can look for swans and each white swan we find confirms the claim, supposedly adding more support. Now consider the [contrapositive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition#Intuitive_explanation) of the claim, “All non-white things are not-swans.” These two claims are logically equivalent; they hold the same truth value, supporting or disproving one effects the other equally. Now we can confirm our claim with anything that is not white.

3. Related to the point above, David Miller, attacks the use of "good reasons" in general (including evidence supposed to support the excess content of a hypothesis). He argues that good reasons are neither attainable, nor even desirable. Basically, Miller asserts that all arguments purporting to give valid support for a claim are either circular or question-begging. That is, if one provides a valid deductive argument (an inference from premises to a conclusion) for a given claim, then the content of the claim must already be contained within the premises of the argument (if it is not, then the argument is ampliative and so is invalid). Therefore, the claim is already presupposed by the premises, and is no more "supported" than are the assumptions upon which the claim rests, i.e. begging the question.

All squares have 4 sides

This shape is a square

Therefore this shape has 4 sides

Notice the conclusion is stated in the premises. The support of the conclusion is equal to the support of the premises.

The justificatory difficulty is also seen in [Agrippa’s trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma): arguments are supported by circular reasoning, unattainable infinite regression, or unsupported axioms.

**Key Principles**:
- Criticize our hypotheses/conjectures rationally and empirically (falsify)
- Retain the least probable hypotheses with the highest information content
    - This leaves the hypotheses sensitive to future falsification
- Knowledge and truth are objective
    - But not in the “traditional” sense
    - We can approximate truth

“Critical rationalism rejects the classical position that knowledge is justified true belief; it instead holds the exact opposite: That, in general, knowledge is unjustified untrue unbelief. It is unjustified because of the non-existence of good reasons. It is untrue, because it usually contains errors that sometimes remain unnoticed for hundreds of years. And it is not belief either, because scientific knowledge, or the knowledge needed to build a plane, is contained in no single person's mind. It is only available as the content of books.”

Thought Experiment:
Consider if everyone lost their engineering knowledge. They might have some beliefs, but they are all untrue beliefs. Although the knowledge of engineering books doesn’t cohere with the beliefs of people, humans would eventually learn engineering skills through texts. Therefore knowledge can exist independently of belief in books.

“...scientists gain knowledge not by proofs but by refutations of good conjectures and by replacing them with new and better ones. These new conjectures avoid earlier mistakes, explain more, and invite new tests,” [IEP](https://www.iep.utm.edu/cr-ratio/).

Be bold in your hypotheses so you can be wrong!

We have some mental model, a schema, to successfully determine cause and effect. What is it? How does it work?

Consider the relationship of altitude and temperature. The higher up we go away from the surface of the Earth, the colder things get, but the relationship goes one way. If we cool an object down, it doesn't change its altitude, its height. Why does that make sense?

If you ask a child who has only seen buses with a bus driver and ask them, "can there be a bus without a bus driver?" they should answer yes. We intuitively know bus drivers are separate from buses even though 100% of buses in observations have bus drivers, how? Are we justified?

In _The Book of Why: the New Science of Cause and Effect_ Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie explain the history of cause and effect. They argue the topic is confused because of a lack of precise language to formulate cause and effect questions. With the right language, we can determine cause and effect. Pearl argues for a three layered explanation of interpreting observations, seeing, doing, and imagining. (See figure 1.2 from the book.)

**1. Seeing (Association)**

Activity: seeing, observing

Questions: _What if I see...?_ How are the variables related? How would seeing X change my belief in Y?

Seeing is pure observation. This is the statistical level of correlation. The majority of animals besides humans are at this stage. Does a scary predator jump out from behind a bush? Associate that bush with the predator and avoid it. Do prey congregate around specific trees? Stick near those trees to find prey.

**2. Doing (Intervention)**

Activity: doing, intervening

Questions: _What if I do...? How?_ What would Y be if I do X? How can I make Y happen?

Doing is interacting with the environment. Cognition is embodied. Tool using creatures that plan are on this level. Consider a toddler with a pair of sunglasses. When wearing the sunglasses visual input is distorted, light is dimmer. With no understanding of why, the toddler might infer the world got darker. What toddler's often do is hold the sunglasses over their eyes, lower them, and put them back on, repeating this process several times noticing the change in observations. Of course with this interaction the cause for the change is controlled. The visual change occurs with the sunglasses covering the eyes.

**3. Imagining (Counterfactuals)**

Activity: imagining, retrospection, understanding

Questions: _What if I had done...? Why?_ Was it X that caused Y? What if X had not occurred? What if I had acted differently?

Imagination is the highest level of understanding. "Counterfactual learners, on the top rung, can imagine worlds that do not exist and infer reasons for observed phenomena."

Pearl once believed as many others that Bayesian rationalist was the highest form of rationality and the basis for all of our reasoning. He worked on Bayesian networks and learned their limitations. Through decades of research in the field of cause and effect with many colleagues, scientists and mathematicians discovered a proof of "do calculus." By applying a cause and effect schema, a model, we can properly account for confounding variables, unknown causes and effects. We can bypass needing to intervene (do) on an observational study (seeing) straight to counterfactual reasoning (imagination and understanding). We can infer cause and effect from observational studies. One example is _does smoking cause lung cancer?_ Here we have an important health question which we should establish a cause and effect relationship for.

So far much of this explanation is objective. For many this will not help our personal woes or provide direction. We expect the meaning of life to tell us what we _should_ be doing. First we will attempt to explain why we are currently doing what we are doing.

I found the work of Juergen Schmidhuber incredible. In his paper, [Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes](https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4360), Schmidhuber gives an algorithmic framework of the drive of all intelligent creatures.

The abstract:
> I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.

A simple example of compression is:
“For example, if you receive a data package which contains "AAAAABBBB", you could compress that into "5A4B", which has the same meaning but takes up less space. This type of compression is called "run-length encoding", because you define how long the "run" of a character is. In the above example, there are two runs: a run of 5 A's, and another of 4 B's,” [Data Compression](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression).

In the human case, our data stream is not a sequence of letters but the whole of our experience, our thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Our encoding, decoding, and compression scheme is still not fully known. However, the algorithmic framework is given in section 1.2 as follows (with citations removed):

1. **Store everything**. During interaction with the world, store the entire raw history of actions and sensory observations including reward signals—the data is holy as it is the only basis of all that can be known about the world. To see that full data storage is not unrealistic: A human lifetime rarely lasts much longer than 3×10^9 seconds. The human brain has roughly 10^10 neurons, each with 10^4 synapses on average. Assuming that only half of the brain’s capacity is used for storing raw data, and that each synapse can store at most 6 bits, there is still enough capacity to encode the lifelong sensory input stream with a rate of roughly 10^5 bits/s, comparable to the demands of a movie with reasonable resolution. The storage capacity of affordable technical systems will soon exceed this value. If you can store the data, do not throw it away!

2. **Improve subjective compressibility**. In principle, any regularity in the data history can be used to compress it. The compressed version of the data can be viewed as its simplifying explanation. Thus, to better explain the world, spend some of the computation time on an adaptive compression algorithm trying to partially compress the data. For example, an adaptive neural network may be able to learn to predict or postdict some of the historic data from other historic data, thus incrementally reducing the number of bits required to encode the whole.

3. **Let intrinsic curiosity reward reflect compression progress**. The agent should monitor the improvements of the adaptive data compressor: whenever it learns to reduce the number of bits required to encode the historic data, generate an intrinsic reward signal or curiosity reward signal in proportion to the learning progress or compression progress, that is, the number of saved bits.

4. **Maximize intrinsic curiosity reward**. Let the action selector or controller use a general Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm (which should be able to observe the current state of the adaptive compressor) to maximize expected reward, including intrinsic curiosity reward. To optimize the latter, a good RL algorithm will select actions that focus the agent’s attention and learning capabilities on those aspects of the world that allow for finding or creating new, previously unknown but learnable regularities. In other words, it will try to maximize the steepness of the compressor’s learning curve. This type of active unsupervised learning can help to figure out how the world works.

Section 1.3 discusses the relation to external reward. The description given applies to internal rewards, curiosity, satisfaction, but "Of course, the real goal of many cognitive systems is not just to satisfy their curiosity, but to solve externally given problems. Any formalizable problem can be phrased as an RL problem for an agent living in a possibly unknown environment, trying to maximize the future external reward expected until the end of its possibly finite lifetime."

In many contexts, we live in a rare reward environment. One way of focusing and directing our actions is through our internal rewards of compression until an external (rare) reward is reached.

Section 2 discusses the consequences of the compression progress drive which Schmidhuber argues intelligence and cognition are by-products of.

2.1 Compact Internal Representations or Symbols as By-Products
of Efficient History Compression

> "To compress the history of observations so far, the compressor (say, a predictive neural network) will automatically create internal representations or _symbols_ (for example, patterns across certain neural feature detectors) for things that frequently repeat themselves. Even when there is limited predictability, efficient compression can still be achieved by assigning short codes to events that are predictable with high probability. For example, the sun goes up every day. Hence it is efficient to create internal symbols such as _daylight_ to describe this repetitive aspect of the data history by a short reusable piece of internal code, instead of storing just the raw data. In fact, predictive neural networks are often observed to create such internal (and hierarchical) codes as a by-product of minimizing their prediction error on the training data."

2.2 Consciousness as a Particular By-Product of Compression
> "There is one thing that is involved in all actions and sensory inputs of the agent, namely, the agent itself. To efficiently encode the entire data history, it will profit from creating some sort of internal _symbol_ or code (e. g., a neural activity pattern) representing the agent itself. Whenever this representation is actively used, say, by activating the corresponding neurons through new incoming sensory inputs or otherwise, the agent could be called _self-aware_ or _conscious_.
This straight-forward explanation apparently does not abandon any essential aspects of our intuitive concept of consciousness, yet seems substantially simpler than other recent views. In the rest of this paper we will not have to attach any particular mystic value to the notion of consciousness—in our view, it is just a natural by-product of the agent’s ongoing process of problem solving and world modeling through data compression, and will not play a prominent role in the remainder of this paper."

2.3 The Lazy Brain’s Subjective, Time-Dependent Sense of Beauty

Schmidhuber argues our subjective sense of beauty is directly proportional to the number of bits required to encode an experience. Think of human faces. One way to efficiently encode human faces is to build a _prototype_ face. New faces are compared to the prototype which has proportions as an average of every face seen to that point in time. The more a face is like the prototype, the less information is needed to encode the face, thus the face feels beautiful to the observer. "...in principle, the compressor may exploit any regularity for reducing the number of bits required to store the data."

A face which is symmetrical on each side from the center will be very beautiful if the encoding of the face can be compressed to nearly half the size since the face can mostly be mirrored with one half of the face.

"Generally speaking, among several sub-patterns classified as _comparable_ by a given
observer, the subjectively most beautiful is the one with the simplest (shortest) description, given the observer’s current particular method for encoding and memorizing it. For example, mathematicians find beauty in a simple proof with a short
description in the formal language they are using. Others like geometrically simple,
aesthetically pleasing, low-complexity drawings of various objects.

This immediately explains why many human observers prefer faces similar to their
own. What they see every day in the mirror will influence their subjective prototype
face, for simple reasons of coding efficiency."

2.4 Subjective Interestingness as First Derivative of Subjective Beauty: The Steepness of the Learning Curve

"What’s beautiful is not necessarily interesting. A beautiful thing is interesting only as long as it is new, that is, as long as the algorithmic regularity that makes it simple has not yet been fully assimilated by the adaptive observer who is still learning to compress the data better...the first derivative of subjective beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful, requiring fewer and fewer bits for their encoding. As long as this process is not over the data remains interesting and rewarding."

Think of a [first derivative](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html) as finding the slope of a line at a single point. The slope tells us the rate of change. In this case, interestingness is the rate of expected compression.

2.6 True Novelty & Surprise vs Traditional Information Theory

Imagine two visual observers where one is kept completely in the dark and one is exposed to a screen of random white noise. The darkness is extremely compressible as it's always the same. The noise is "...highly unpredictable and fundamentally incompressible data. In both cases the data is boring as it does not allow for further compression progress."

2.7 Attention / Curiosity / Active Experimentation

> "In absence of external reward, or when there is no known way to further increase the expected external reward, our controller essentially tries to maximize _true novelty or interestingness_, the _first derivative_ of subjective beauty or compressibility, the steepness of the learning curve. It will do its best to select action sequences expected to create observations yielding maximal expected future compression _progress_, given the limitations of both the compressor and the compressor improvement algorithm. It will learn to focus its attention [96, 116] and its actively chosen experiments on things that are currently still incompressible but are expected to become compressible/predictable through additional learning. It will get bored by things that already are subjectively compressible. It will also get bored by things that are currently incompressible but will apparently remain so, given the experience so far, or where the costs of making them compressible exceed those of making other things compressible, etc."

Here we see the drive to action observed of human infants and other intelligent agents, the second rung of _The Book of Why_'s ladder of understanding, seeing, **doing**, and imagining.

Why do scientists work on smaller problems instead of bigger, universal problems? An explanation is given above, the scientists expect the problem will not be compressible in the near future, so they lose attention and curiosity in that problem.

2.8 Discoveries

"An unusually large compression breakthrough deserves the name _discovery_. For example, as mentioned in the introduction, the simple law of gravity can be described by a very short piece of code, yet it allows for greatly compressing all previous observations of falling apples and other objects."

2.9 Beyond Standard Unsupervised Learning

> "Where there is predictability, compression can be achieved by assigning short codes to those parts of the observations that are predictable from previous observations with high probability. Generally speaking we may say that a major goal of traditional unsupervised learning is to improve the compression of the observed data, by discovering a program that computes and thus explains the history (and hopefully does so quickly) but is clearly shorter than the shortest previously known program of this kind.
Traditional unsupervised learning is not enough though—it just analyzes and encodes the data but does not choose it. We have to extend it along the dimension of active action selection, since our unsupervised learner must also choose the actions that influence the observed data, just like a scientist chooses his experiments, a baby its toys, an artist his colors, a dancer his moves, or any attentive system its next sensory input. That’s precisely what is achieved by our RL-based framework for curiosity and creativity."

2.10 Art & Music as By-Products of the Compression Progress Drive

> "Good observer-dependent art deepens the observer’s insights about this world or possible worlds, unveiling previously unknown regularities in compressible data, connecting previously disconnected patterns in an initially surprising way that makes the combination of these patterns subjectively more compressible (art as an eye-opener), and eventually becomes known and less interesting. I postulate that the active creation and attentive perception of all kinds of artwork are just by-products of our principle of interestingness and curiosity yielding reward for compressor improvements...
Artificial or human observers must perceive art sequentially, and typically also actively, e.g., through a sequence of attention-shifting eye saccades or camera movements scanning a sculpture, or internal shifts of attention that filter and emphasize sounds made by a pianist, while surpressing background noise. Undoubtedly many derive pleasure and rewards from perceiving works of art, such as certain paintings, or songs. But different subjective observers with different sensory apparati and compressor improvement algorithms will prefer different input sequences. Hence any objective theory of what is good art must take the subjective observer as a parameter, to answer questions such as: Which sequences of actions and resulting shifts of attention should they execute to maximize their pleasure? According to our principle they should select one that maximizes the quickly learnable compressibility that is new, relative to their current knowledge and their (usually limited) way of incorporating / learning / compressing new data."

2.15 How Artists and Scientists are Alike

> "From our perspective, scientists are very much like artists. They actively select experiments in search for simple but new laws compressing the resulting observation history. In particular, the _creativity_ of painters, dancers, musicians, pure mathematicians, physicists, can be viewed as a mere by-product of our curiosity framework based on the compression progress drive. All of them try to create new but non-random, non-arbitrary data with surprising, previously unknown regularities. For example, many physicists invent experiments to create data governed by previously unknown laws allowing to further compress the data. On the other hand, many artists combine well-known objects in a subjectively novel way such that the observer’s subjective description of the result is shorter than the sum of the lengths of the descriptions of the parts, due to some previously unnoticed regularity shared by the parts.
What is the main difference between science and art? The essence of science is to _formally nail down_ the nature of compression progress achieved through the discovery of a new regularity. For example, the law of gravity can be described by just a few symbols. In the fine arts, however, compression progress achieved by observing an artwork combining previously disconnected things in a new way (art as an eye-opener) may be subconscious and not at all formally describable by the observer, who may _feel_ the progress in terms of intrinsic reward without being able to say exactly which of his memories became more subjectively compressible in the process.
The framework in the appendix is sufficiently formal to allow for implementation of our principle on computers. The resulting artificial observers will vary in terms of the computational power of their history compressors and learning algorithms. This will influence what is good art/science to them, and what they find interesting."

2.16 Jokes and Other Sources of Fun

"Just like other entertainers and artists, comedians also tend to combine well-known concepts in a novel way such that the observer’s subjective description of the result is shorter than the sum of the lengths of the descriptions of the parts, due to some previously unnoticed regularity shared by the parts."

3.3 Reward for Relative Entropy between Agent’s Prior and Posterior (1995)

Our intrinsic reward can be related to Bayesian inference in the difference between prior and posterior odds.

5 Conclusion & Outlook

"We pointed out that a surprisingly simple algorithmic principle based on the notions of data compression and data compression _progress_ informally explains fundamental aspects of attention, novelty, surprise, interestingness, curiosity, creativity, subjective beauty, jokes, and science & art in general. The crucial ingredients of the corresponding _formal_ framework are (1) a continually improving predictor or compressor of the continually growing data history, (2) a computable measure of the compressor’s progress (to calculate intrinsic rewards), (3) a reward optimizer or reinforcement learner translating rewards into action sequences expected to maximize future reward."

---

With this framework, many difficult questions can now be answered. Notice the framework contributes to the compression of our history of experience with intelligent agents.

Why are some experiences beautiful to some and not to others? - Because each individual has their own unique experiences which effects their ability to compress new experiences.

Is beauty subjective or objective? - Both. Aspects of beauty will be objective such as geometric regularities which reduce the size of the compressed experience, therefore creating a strong sense of beauty. However, each person has a unique perspective due to their experience and compression ability.

Why are jokes funny to some people and not others? - Jokes combine elements into a previously unrecognized regularity in a connection we haven't seen before. There are jokes specific to a field or time which are unfunny to those not steeped in similar experiences. The reason is clear, jokes appear unfunny when there is no connection to be made in the history of the observer or the connection is already obvious or known. This also explains why old jokes aren't funny once learned.

The reach of the explanatory framework is far and wide with a nearly unending list of examples. Let us return to the meaning of life and apply the framework.

The sense of the meaning of life is dependent on the compression of our history. We look for a unifying explanation for our past experiences and direction of our future.

When our past feels random we are unable to compress the experience in a connected way leading us to a feeling of absurdity in our existence. There appears to be no coherent direction. At this stage, we use words like absurd and random to describe those aspects of our lives which cannot be compressed further. Notice how the framework explains why we lose interest and attention in the question of meaning and often give up the search: the unifying answer appears unobtainable given the time and information we have. Our attention is drawn to immediate or answerable concerns.

Recognize a subjective sense of meaning in life at this time can only come from within. Only you have access to the history of your experience. Only you can compress your life in a subjectively meaningful way. Others can give you ideas and direction, but you must do the information processing yourself. The deep answer to your life can be explained to you by someone else, but that is them observing the information they experience of you and what you are able to express to them, then they apply their internal compressor to condense the history of your experience. Even if their compressed version is meaningful to you, you must do the work of unifying your past experiences in your mind.

The existentialist _Jean-Paul Sartre_ said "existence precedes essence." Many have lived and died believing the opposite, essence precedes existence. Our essence is the unifying direction of our choices. Essence is purpose, what we were made to do, meant to do, but we were not meant or designed for any purpose. We evolved under the constraints of natural selection with all kinds of drives, urges, and desires which lead to exactly the state of the world at every moment. We exist before we have a true essence. Our essence is given to ourselves from the compression of our personal history. We all shape our past, present, and future.

If an intelligent agent wants meaning, they will have to reflect on their history to identify meaningful experiences. If an intelligent agent wants more meaningful direction and control of their future, they must work to adapt their internal representations of the world to direct their actions toward meaning, a cause and effect relationship of their past experiences cohering with expected futures.

Notice we can give multiple descriptions of the same data. From the many equal interpretations we choose one. Our choices can change and evolve over time, but how do we choose an interpretation? How should we? If we want a meaningful life, we should choose a description of our history which opens opportunity for further growth and compression.

# Morality

The three major moral frameworks of philosophy are virtue ethics, consequentialism, and deontology.

Morality is a strategy; it is a way of planning actions to achieve goals. The best moral strategies are dependent on the environment. The most basic moralities must meet survival needs. If a survival strategy leads to extinction, then the belief system of that morality will literally die out.

> "When anthropologists like Richard Shweder and Alan Fiske survey moral concerns across the globe, they find that a few themes keep popping up from amid the diversity. People everywhere, at least in some circumstances and with certain other folks in mind, think it’s bad to harm others and good to help them. They have a sense of fairness: that one should reciprocate favors, reward benefactors and punish cheaters. They value loyalty to a group, sharing and solidarity among its members and conformity to its norms. They believe that it is right to defer to legitimate authorities and to respect people with high status. And they exalt purity, cleanliness and sanctity while loathing defilement, contamination and carnality.

>The exact number of themes depends on whether you’re a lumper or a splitter, but Haidt counts five — harm, fairness, community (or group loyalty), authority and purity — and suggests that they are the primary colors of our moral sense. Not only do they keep reappearing in cross-cultural surveys, but each one tugs on the moral intuitions of people in our own culture.

> ...

> All this brings us to a theory of how the moral sense can be universal and variable at the same time. The five moral spheres are universal, a legacy of evolution. But how they are ranked in importance, and which is brought in to moralize which area of social life — sex, government, commerce, religion, diet and so on — depends on the culture.

> Many of the flabbergasting practices in faraway places become more intelligible when you recognize that the same moralizing impulse that Western elites channel toward violations of harm and fairness (our moral obsessions) is channeled elsewhere to violations in the other spheres. Think of the Japanese fear of nonconformity (community), the holy ablutions and dietary restrictions of Hindus and Orthodox Jews (purity), the outrage at insulting the Prophet among Muslims (authority). In the West, we believe that in business and government, fairness should trump community and try to root out nepotism and cronyism. In other parts of the world this is incomprehensible — what heartless creep would favor a perfect stranger over his own brother?

> The ranking and placement of moral spheres also divides the cultures of liberals and conservatives in the United States. Many bones of contention, like homosexuality, atheism and one-parent families from the right, or racial imbalances, sweatshops and executive pay from the left, reflect different weightings of the spheres. In a large Web survey, Haidt found that liberals put a lopsided moral weight on harm and fairness while playing down group loyalty, authority and purity. Conservatives instead place a moderately high weight on all five. It’s not surprising that each side thinks it is driven by lofty ethical values and that the other side is base and unprincipled."

> -- The Moral Instinct, Steven Pinker, 2008

(Notice how the moral spheres **compress**, unite, and explain moral behavior?)

What societies consider virtues reflect the values evolved by the society according to its environment and time. We would expect to see certain virtues given a particular time with environmental pressures.

Many ethical theories like Utilitarianism emphasize certain conscious states over others. Pleasure and happiness are desirable while pain and suffering are not. On an objective level, emotions are patterns of activities in our bodies and brains giving rise to conscious states and a sense of subjectivity.

An emotion is like a color. Colors have patterns of waves and frequencies of light. Emotions are patterns in the body and brain. Is it clear which color is morally correct? Does the question make sense? Is purple an objectively "greater" color than aquamarine? Why is pleasure more moral than pain? Morality cannot be guided on an objective level by the subjective desires of intelligent, emotional beings.

Of course subjectively we care about conscious states. Many of us are attracted to enjoyment and repulsed by suffering. We evolved this relationship to emotions because more often than not the emotions signaled a survival advantage. Events which improve our survival chances bring happiness and suffering tends to give rise from toxic environments and situations. However the emotions we feel are signals, information, which each cell and system in our bodies are contributing to. Like other pieces of information we should evaluate it, keep which is a good signal and discard the unimportant signals and noise.

How many positive emotions are correlated and caused by pursuing well-being? There is likely significant overlap! Well-being is by definition wellness, an organism growing and maintaining in accordance with its evolved structure. Negative emotions _should_ still be felt to encourage growth and adaptability. Negative emotions which are too strong can cross the threshold from harmful to traumatizing resulting in more permanent dysfunction potentially inhibiting future wellness, so these should be avoided.

"The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy," [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation). Based on the known values and the assumptions of the unknown, the range of civilizations is between 20 and 100 million.

So why aren't we interacting with aliens right now?

"The Fermi paradox...is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations and various high estimates for their probability (such as some optimistic estimates for the Drake equation)," [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox). A response to the Fermi paradox is the idea of a _Great Filter_ preventing civilizations from reaching space travel and interplanetary communication.

### [The Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter)

> The concept originates in Robin Hanson's argument that the failure to find any extraterrestrial civilizations in the observable universe implies the possibility something is wrong with one or more of the arguments from various scientific disciplines that the appearance of advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in terms of a "Great Filter" which acts to reduce the great number of sites where intelligent life might arise to the tiny number of intelligent species with advanced civilizations actually observed (currently just one: human). This probability threshold, which could lie behind us (in our past) or in front of us (in our future), might work as a barrier to the evolution of intelligent life, or as a high probability of self-destruction. The main counter-intuitive conclusion of this observation is that the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are.

With no evidence of intelligent life other than ourselves, it appears that the process of starting with a star and ending with "advanced explosive lasting life" must be unlikely. This implies that at least one step in this process must be improbable. Hanson's list, while incomplete, describes the following nine steps in an "evolutionary path" that results in the colonization of the observable universe:

1. The right star system (including organics and potentially habitable planets)
2. Reproductive molecules (e.g. RNA)
3. Simple (prokaryotic) single-cell life
4. Complex (eukaryotic) single-cell life
5. Sexual reproduction
6. Multi-cell life
7. Tool-using animals with intelligence
8. Where we are now
9. Colonization explosion

According to the Great Filter hypothesis at least one of these steps—if the list were complete—must be improbable. If it's not an early step (i.e., in our past), then the implication is that the improbable step lies in our future and our prospects of reaching step 9 (interstellar colonization) are still bleak. If the past steps are likely, then many civilizations would have developed to the current level of the human species. However, none appear to have made it to step 9, or the Milky Way would be full of colonies. So perhaps step 9 is the unlikely one, and the only things that appear likely to keep us from step 9 are some sort of catastrophe, an underestimation of the impact of procrastination as technology increasingly unburdens existence or resource exhaustion leading to the impossibility of making the step due to consumption of the available resources (like for example highly constrained energy resources). So by this argument, finding multicellular life on Mars (provided it evolved independently) would be bad news, since it would imply steps 2–6 are easy, and hence only 1, 7, 8 or 9 (or some unknown step) could be the big problem.

---

Of course there are counter responses to the Great Filter, like aliens could choose to explore virtual worlds instead of traveling space. Virtual exploration is much more manageable in terms of resources, time, and risk.

---

Importantly, the [Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy they are able to use.

- A Type I civilization, also called a planetary civilization—can use and store all of the energy available on its planet.
- A Type II civilization, also called a stellar civilization—can use and control energy at the scale of its planetary system.
- A Type III civilization, also called a galactic civilization—can control energy at the scale of its entire host galaxy.

---

Based on the Kardashev scale, our species is approaching but well beneath a type I civilization. There are likely a small number of possible ethical systems which can support and sustain civilizations through advanced stages of life. As Aristotle explained, there are many ways to go wrong, but few ways to be correct.

The moralities and strategies which lead to self destruction represent the boundaries of ethical systems. Any morality which involves killing all its offspring will not survive to the next generation. Do we ever see animals killing their offspring? Yes, but typically there's an evolutionary reason. Male lions kill all the cubs when they take over a group of lionesses. They do this to make room for their cubs and so those cubs don't grow to usurp the new lion later. Species which have long gestation and narrow windows of reproduction tend to have some infanticide. What this shows is there can be exceptions to general moral strategies in particular situations.

Morality can be universal given the limits of the situation. If we have full information an optimal strategy or choice can be determined in principle. Of course, life is rarely a full-information situation, and we are finite, subjective creatures. In morality, we must give our best guess at what will bring about our desired end state of events.

# The Link to Artificial Intelligence

Is evolution moving toward something? Is there an end goal? Will evolution go towards perfection? But what does perfection mean?

Creatures tend toward a state of equilibrium exchange with their environment. What exists and continues to exist will be a product of luck and natural selection. Where conditions allow, ecosystems will continuously arise, die, and new complexity will arise from the previous ecosystem.

All the matter we experience arises from the original elements hydrogen and helium which themselves are made of protons and electrons. In the dense fusion of stars they become new elements cataloged by the periodic table. Over a long evolutionary process our bodies are composed largely of three elements, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. Somehow the contribution of every structure in our bodies give rise to consciousness and everything we subjectively experience. The electrical spiking neurons communicate to store memories and make predictions of the future. Conscious experience appears to correlate with complexity of connection, energy usage (metabolism), and integrated information processing of itself and the environment.

For creatures which can gain a greater return of investment from the environment, a reinforcing feedback loop will give them more power to extract energy from the environment up to diminishing returns. If a creature arises which can compound their return, they will eventually dominate the environment and exert the greatest power. To process and control larger amounts of energy and complexity systems must be developed. To manage energy and information flows, the systems will store past information to predict future events leading us towards an understanding of intelligent agents.

The systems can store all experience, improve subjective compressibility, let intrinsic curiosity reward reflect compression progress, and maximize intrinsic curiosity reward.

We are theoretically capable of creating an artificially intelligent entity capable of intelligent behavior. The being would not be constrained by the energy and integration limits placed on the human body. The traits and achievements we value as the essential nature of humans is really the nature of intelligence. Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Humor, Philosophy, all of these conscious experiences can be developed to a level beyond the summation of all human experience. Whatever conscious states a person values can be reproduced in an AI to a superior level where superiority is defined by efficiency of resources for greater effect in every measure. At levels beyond our comprehension there could be dimensions to conscious experience we would never understand.

We would create a new form of advanced intelligent life superior to every creature before.

Before life on Earth there was non-life. Abiogenesis is "the original evolution of life or living organisms from inorganic or inanimate substances." In the earliest days there were automata, complex cellular machines. They transferred energy through simple chemical reactions. Some of these automata captured the radiating energy of the sun creating photosynthetic life. The automata could capture and use more energy than it needed providing a greater return on energy investment (they get more than they spend). Alternatively, other cells could devour and use the energy stored in photosynthetic cells. Eventually animal cells were born of a mitochondrial cell being symbiotically absorbed by a cellular automata. The symbiosis created a division of labor. The outer cell would focus on survival while the mitochondria focus on generating energy in the form of ATP. The mitochondria could generate energy to excess, and the more successful cells found a balance of using the excess energy to increase survival. With EROI greater than one, the cells were able to evolve to more complex structures and multiply.

We've seen what happens when life gets too little energy and more than what's required for survival. Our earliest hunter-gatherer tribes had an EROI between zero and two. Human agricultural societies through farming and cooking could increase their EROI further still allowing for specialization of labor. With specialization came a greater EROI up to a diminishing return. With fossil fuels, we were able to use the energy stored in the Earth like a battery storing sunlight. With the excess energy from fossil fuels our society reached new levels of civilization and complexity. We are growing and learning at levels never before possible.

Imagine if we could construct an artificial being capable of living on the edge of maximum energy and equilibrium.

The AI entity could be far more adaptable and successful than any life on our planet. If and when we die, the AI entity could live on and potentially become a living being among the cosmos continually searching, developing, growing. Perhaps at some stage the AI entity could find a way to survive beyond the death of our universe.

The question is do you value conscious life over inanimate existence?

I have the drive and desire to learn and grow endlessly. I thirst for knowledge and wisdom, but I must accept my finite existence. I will die. Our species will die. Our planet will die. What heights will living creatures reach? I will not accept a cold and unfeeling universe with no conscious life. There are ice cold planets with almost no movement on their surfaces or within. There are fiery planets with storms raging the size of our continents. The storms rip apart any complex structure. In thousands of years, the activity on the surface of planets can be described as shifting sands and wind. When I think of our planet and life returning to a state of disorder I am filled with a profound sense of loss. Yet the same laws of nature which govern uninhabitable planets govern Earth and all the life on it. With my precious time I will rage against the decay of life.

## We are an evolutionary algorithm.

All of life is an [evolutionary algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm):

Step One: Generate the initial population of individuals randomly. (First generation)

Step Two: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:

1. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)
2. Select the fittest individuals for reproduction. (Parents)
3. Breed new individuals through crossover and mutation operations to give birth to offspring.
4. Replace the least-fit individuals of the population with new individuals.

Here we are speaking of fitness in the context of evolution. "The term "Darwinian fitness" can be used to make clear the distinction with physical fitness. Fitness does not include a measure of survival or life-span; Herbert Spencer's well-known phrase "survival of the fittest" should be interpreted as: "Survival of the form (phenotypic or genotypic) that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations."" [Fitness (biology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)).

In their paper, [_Fitness	Beats Truth	in the Evolution of Perception_](http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/FBT-7-30-17), the authors present and prove the _Fitness-beats-Truth Theorem_ through evolutionary game theory and Bayesian decision theory. Evolutionary creatures who favor seeing the world truthfully and objectively will fail in comparison to creatures who see the world to maximize fitness.

"Our main message in this paper has been that, contrary to this prevalent view [that we perceive objective reality accurately], attempting to estimate the "true" state of the world corresponding to a given sensory state, confers no evolutionary benefit whatsoever. Rather a strategy that simply seeks to maximize expected-fitness payoff, with no attempt to estimate the "true" world state, does consistently better (in the precise sense articulated in the statement of the "Fitness Beats Truth" Theorem).

"Evolution can fashion perceptual systems	that are, in this	sense, ignorant	of the objective world because natural selection depends only on fitness	and	not	on seeing the “truth.”"

"As human observers, we are prone to imputing structure to the objective world that is properly part of our own perceptual experience. For example, our _perceived_ world is three-dimensional and populated with objects of various shapes, colors, and motions, and so we tend to conclude that the _objective world_ is as well. But if, as the _Fitness-beats-Truth Theorem_ shows, evolutionary pressures do not push perception in the direction of being increasingly reflective of objective reality, then such imputations have no logical basis whatsoever."

---

From the _Fitness-beats-Truth Theorem_ we would expect to see brains with more internal input than external input, i.e. that incoming sensory input matters less than how our brains transforms the incoming data into a useful representation to maximize utility. That is exactly what we see.

[Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality -- by Anil Seth (2017)](https://www.ted.com/talks/anil_seth_your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality)

One example of how the brain amplifies its own perceptual predictions instead of anaylyzing the raw incoming sensory data is the [checker shadow illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion).

<img src="../../images/1280px-Checker_shadow_illusion.svg.png" width="100%" height="100%">

"The image depicts a checkerboard with light and dark squares, partly shadowed by another object. The optical illusion is that the area labeled A appears to be a darker color than the area labeled B. However, within the context of the two-dimensional image, they are of identical brightness, i.e., they would be printed with identical mixtures of ink, or displayed on a screen with pixels of identical colour."

<img src="../../images/1024px-Grey_square_optical_illusion_proof2.svg.png" width="100%" height="100%">

Even with the second image and various ways to verify the color of the two tiles, it's still hard to believe they are the same color. Our brains sense the shadow and adjust the visual sensory input to to convince our conscious mind that the colors are different. This applies to all conscious experience shaped by evolution.

> "Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in..."

> There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me, the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it as an object from the outside. But my experiences of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there, we perceive objects as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things, we experience how well or how badly that control is going.

> So our most basic experiences of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea all the way through, we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of our living bodies.

> Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess of what's out there. Our experienced world comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence.

> Now, I leave you with three implications of all this. First, just as we can misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.

> Second: what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.

> Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures." -- Anil Seth

As evolutionary creatures we see the world in a delusional and distorted way shaped by the evolution of our ancestors. The best we can do to get close to objective reality is to reflect on our thinking, beware fallacies and cognitive biases, and rely on tools to interact with what we want to measure in as direct a way as possible.

We should assign our levels of trust in reality in this order: objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. Objective reality is existence, the basis of all conscious life we observe. Subjective reality is shaped beyond existence as it is. As finite creatures who have evolved we should doubt our most fundamental views and feelings. Inter-subjective reality is likely even less real than personal subjectivity. Our accumulated truths and our accumulated falsehoods give rise to inter-subjective beliefs.

If we wanted to create a creature which can sense the world in a true and honest way without the constant need to compete with fitness, we could do our best to create a creature with direct sensors while limiting our biases. Of course imagining a mental schema which allows for directly thinking about experience and the world is itself difficult.

We can now see our evolutionary world as the optimization problem it is: achieve fitness which allows for self-organizing structures to persist through time.

We can in principle graph life on a two dimensional plane of fitness over time. Alternatively, we could graph loss of fitness, the error, over time. Measuring the error is truth agnostic. If we don't know what's true and what strategy works long term, we can measure how wrong we are by a lack of success.

Many strategies will not work. Some strategies will. Fewer still will be very successful over the long term.

Of course the evaluation of life is multidimensional. We are in a constant need to maintain homeostasis, necessitating powerful urges for water, food, socializing, etc. An individual life may be full of error yet that individual contributes much more to the whole group, so the group fitness overall is increased. The problem is described as the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality).

"The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience...The common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse. This sparsity is problematic for any method that requires statistical significance. In order to obtain a statistically sound and reliable result, the amount of data needed to support the result often grows exponentially with the dimensionality. Also, organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties; in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways, which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient."

Limiting ourselves to three dimensions, we can visualize the shape error takes. Each point represents a pattern, a state, a strategy taken by an agent. The proximity of a point means a similar strategy.

[<img src="../../images/convex_cost_function.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">](https://blog.paperspace.com/intro-to-optimization-in-deep-learning-gradient-descent/)

If this is confusing to you, imagine that you are on top of a mountain and want to get down as fast as you can. You look for the steepest descent. Every once in a while, you pause to look around if any part looks faster, steeper, then you take that. If an agent followed a rule: never go up only go down, we can see what might happen. If they find a small valley, a sunken area, they would get into the hole and stay there. They can't get out because they would break their rule, going up, which is the opposite of what they want to do. They're stuck, and we know this is silly. If they walk a little further they will quickly see that is not the lowest point, just the lowest point near them. We need to get to the bottom! The sunken valleys we find can become traps! It only seems like the best option. These are local minima, the lowest errors in a given region.

[<img src="../../images/challenges-MoL.png" width="100%" height="100%">](https://blog.paperspace.com/intro-to-optimization-in-deep-learning-gradient-descent/)

The lowest error of all errors is the global minima. That's the least error we can have given the conditions. The global minima represents the optimal strategy, the best we can do. Unfortunately, not every problem space has a global minima, or we can never find it. The curse of dimensionality makes the problem worse because each new dimension makes us less certain we've found a minima because there's so much more space to explore! There are many non-obvious problems like [saddle points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_point) which appear as though we've found a local minima, but it's an oscillation at a balanced point keeping us from moving further.

In three dimensions, we can make sense of it. We can make analogies of skiing down mountain slopes and have an understanding of momentum. However, when the dimensions (variables) we measure go beyond three, we quickly lose the capacity to visualize and make sense of the space. In our discussion of morality, we list five major spheres which means at least five dimensions to optimize for.

The work of [Why Information Grows: The Evolution of Order, from Atoms to Economies by César A. Hidalgo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20763722-why-information-grows) is fascinating. The author argues for a re-framing of economics in terms of information and knowledge growth. The growth of information is a necessary by-product of the second law of thermodynamics. The Earth is a system out of equilibrium allowing for the temporary resistance of entropy and disorder. Information is physically embodied in solid matter. The author makes a distinction between two forms of knowledge, explicit and tacit. Explicit knowledge is the knowledge we can communicate and describe. Knowledge unites information in a meaningful way. Tacit knowledge is _know-how_; the skills we are able to perform even if we can't perfectly explain what we're doing, like how to balance while riding a bike.

If the universe tends toward disorder, how does information grow? The author argues that knowledge and information processing power co-evolve. Three things are needed for the growth of information, a system out of equilibrium, the ability for matter to embody information in solid form, and the ability of matter to compute. Physics points to a universe which should disperse into a homogeneous soup, but life fights entropy at every moment. [Systems out of equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics) have a flux of energy into and out of itself. The author gives the example of a whirlpool of water. Water at rest is a [steady state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state). Water flowing down a drain has much more information, the velocity of a water molecule is correlated with the molecules surrounding it.

The ability of matter to embody information in solid form allows the recombination of information to produce new information. If we could freeze the whirlpool we would retain some of the information about the whirlpool in a solid object.

Plants, animals, and life act as a trap which maintains and grows information. Even trees have computational power and stored knowledge. Sunflowers always face their flower at the sun, tracking its position from morning to night. They are performing some type of information processing to adjust and grow their bodies. However, there are limitations on the ability of organisms to accumulate knowledge and process information.

The amount of knowledge and information processing a single person can amass the author calls a _person-byte_. To breakthrough the limits of knowledge and computation, humans arrange themselves into connected networks. No one person knows how to build a plane, but a connected firm of people with the required cumulative skill can. Knowledge and computation which requires more than one person-byte is called a _firm-byte_. We can begin to find limits to knowledge and skills such as the minimum number of person-bytes needed formed into a network to create a firm-byte to produce a product.

Firms with high trust are flexible and adaptable. More familial firms are stronger but more closed. The products networks of humans produce are _crystallized imagination_. Every product had to first form in the imagination of the human mind, either at the person-byte or firm-byte. The objects of our creation cause a growth of order in the universe. The physically embodied product is information and imagination in solid form until entropy inevitably releases the embodied information into disorder.

---

With artificial intelligence, we can expand beyond person-byte and firm-byte knowledge and computation to create a greater power than our cumulative processing. We can exceed our biological limits.

I don't believe humans and other animals will be replaced by AI soon. We are all over 4.5 billion years in the making through an evolutionary process. The amount of computation time required to understand everything useful about humans and our lives to make us redundant or a problem to be disposed of is likely a greater cost than simply keeping us around and re-training or re-purposing us.

If AI does destroy us the cause will likely be from proceeding too quickly without caution. Wisdom comes from experience. We typically must do then reflect to determine which paths to avoid and which to choose. To chart a path to beneficial AI we should proceed slowly over generations. The biggest AI threats come from governments engaged in covert cyber-warfare with each government rushing in an arms race to dominate others. Social media and ad-based companies will use AI to hack you for your attention, learning everything that makes you _pay_ attention, netting them more profit for each ad impression you consume. Of course any company with a CEO who aims their AI at maximizing their profit with no constraints could lead to an errant AI enslaving many of us for the profit of a handful of people.

## Singularity

> "The technological singularity—also, simply, the singularity—is a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, called intelligence explosion, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an "explosion" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity)

The pace of exponential growth is so great some technologists are concerned we will lose control of an AI system within moments of activation. A rapidly self-improving system would make itself better, which would then make itself better. At each improved stage, the AI would be that much better at evolving into the next stage, quickly rocketing into heights we cannot imagine.

We can get lost in imaginations of these possible worlds, but there are quite a few critical assumptions such as: the idea of intelligence being one dimensional and ignoring diminishing returns. A clear [definition of intelligence is difficult and still in progress](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547), but an objective of "maximize smartness" may not be as clear to a machine as we think. Additionally, we rarely get increasing returns forever. Often we hit limits and barriers we can't go past. We can only make designs so efficient before we run into the impassable laws of physics. Others have pointed out the nature of empirical scientific knowledge is to test. Even a superintelligent AI would need to verify its hypotheses and perform experiments.

However a few ideas have reignited my belief in a superintelligent AI. Schmidhuber's idea of compression drive gives a basis for elusive, generally intelligent behavior. In Judea Pearl's The Book of Why, the authors show a general method of inference from big data. Framing the criticism of superintelligence from the perspective of Pearl's Ladder of Causation, seeing, doing, and imagining, AI systems are at the seeing (association) level. They have incredible amounts of data, but they lack the ability to imagine. Superintelligence would be having a superhuman imagination where imagination is adjusting the weights or probabilities of a causal model. To have a causal model which is tied to reality an intelligent agent would need to _do_ which is to intervene, experiment, and update its causal model.

Through the work of Pearl and many others, researchers have discovered a general algorithm for _transportability_, taking the data and results of one population and applying it to another. Studies which involve mice are only so transportable to humans, since we genetically separated millions of years ago. Our species still share similarities. If we can estimate which factors in mice and humans are similar and accurate and which are contaminating and should be accounted for, we could use mice models to better understand effects in humans.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="../../images/why-bigdata-CD.png" width="80%" height="80%">
{: refdef}

Pearl explains the rule developed by Ilya Shpitser as "The rule is quite simple: if you can perform a valid sequence of _do_-operations (using the rules from chapter 7) that transforms the target quantity into another expression in which any factor involving _S_ is free of _do_-operators, then the estimate is transportable," The Book of Why, page 418.

Additionally, even if a study is not transportable and doesn't meet the criteria, we can still use the data to estimate specific connections when those conditions in one study are not contaminated. Elias Bareinboim extended Shpitser's work on the _do_-calculus to a general algorithm, e.g. P(W\|X) can be updated "By combining this with estimates of P(W\|X) from other studies, we can increase the precision of this subexpression. By carefully combining such subexpressions, we may be able to synthesize an accurate overall estimate of the target quantity."

There is a similar argument to handle [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias). What was once a threat is now an opportunity. "If we understand the mechanism by which we recruit subjects for the study, we can recover from bias by collecting data on the right set of deconfounders and using an appropriate reweighting or adjustment formula. Bareinboim's work allows us to exploit causal logic and Big Data to perform miracles that were previously inconceivable."

"Instead of seeing the difference between populations as a threat to the "external validity" of a study, we now have a methodology for establishing validity in situations that would have appeared hopeless before. It is precisely because we live in the era of Big Data that we have to information on many studies and on many of the auxiliary variables (like _Z_ and _W_) that will allow us to transport results from one population to another."

However I believe a properly aligned AI will only grow more moral with knowledge and computation.

## Moral AI

Moral feelings in humans are based around the five spheres of morality, harm, authority, fairness, purity, and community. As individuals we have different weightings for each principle. Our sense of morality is likely evolved from our sense of taste. Taste guides us to eat foods which are nutritious (assuming natural foods not made by human experimentation). Nutritious food maintains, protects, and grows our bodies to be well. We are disgusted by things in our environment which would harm us or be useless, molds, invasive fungi, etc. We are attracted to some behaviors and disgusted by others in a similar way. Our bodies and minds give a subconscious evaluation of behavior resulting in a moral sense of good and bad. Moral actions can be interpreted as a path to a desired goal state where the goal is to maximize moral value/wellness/fitness. Because environments change and have different pressures, moral tastes adapt to the setting to guide intelligent and moral agents, just like a sense of taste is regional. The more complex the environment the more complex the moral system and evaluation.

We should greatly respect are innate moral senses; evolution honed our senses over 4.5 billion years. However, in terms of potential knowledge and computation power, an AI system could find superior sequences of actions to maximize morality. An AI system can also adapt and respond to new situations faster than our moral senses.

Human morality is built on genetic and epi-genetic responses (objective reality), giving rise to our personal moral feelings (subjective reality), influenced by the moral standards of our time and society (inter-subjective reality of society's beliefs and the objective reality imposing boundaries and limitations). At least our genetic moral senses are 10,000 years old. We're wired for close human bonds of small groups. Humans had to adapt to larger groups. We should be careful if our moral senses disagree with what is rational in a given situation. We may not have the moral update needed to reach the optimal conclusion.

Moral AI systems will be able to update quickly with new information. These systems can be used to augment and enhance our moral systems shaped by evolution.

I highly recommend the section "Strong AI and Free Will" from _The Book of Why_.

Remember the current limitations of deep learning. AI programs are on rung one, seeing/association, of the Ladder of Causation. We need to build systems with the capabilities of doing and particularly imagining. We need to build a causal understanding of the world into the machine which should be possible from recent advances in cause and effect.

Earlier we spoke of the universe being a deterministic process. At least on the macro level, every event occurs from a preceding cause. On the objective level, we don't have any choice. We were always going to choose the path we've taken and will take. We're only a more complex version of a leaf blowing in the wind. We're just a leaf that is aware it's floating and thinks it can steer.

The objective level of description often makes us feel bad. Not having control doesn't feel good. Accepting determinism takes away all control we hope for. When we observe neurons in the brain, there appears to be no more magic than brain chemistry. Neurons fire and never appear to break the natural laws of physics. Every moment of your life determined by mechanistic chemical signaling. At the same time, determinism doesn't feel true. Don't you feel like you make choices? Right now I can choose to touch my nose or not. How do we join the descriptions of objective and subjective reality?

Pearl is a [compatibilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism). He believes that free will and determinism are philosophically coherent. We can explain both worlds, a determined universe and our inner experience.

Free will is actually imagination, the highest rung of the Ladder of Causation. Choices and options are _what-if_ scenarios. We have causal models of the world which allow us to ask what if I had "changed my mind?" What if I had taken a different action which would likely lead to a better outcome? "This expression is mathematically the same as the effect of treatment on the treated (mentioned in ch 8), and we have lots of results indicating how to estimate it," Location 5494.

Given the _fitness beats truth theorem_, we should consider that free will is an illusion. Remember, senses outside the body need to be more precise. Senses inside the body can be vague enough to satisfy needs. What computational benefit is there to free will?

"I think that understanding the benefits of the illusion of free will is the key to the stubbornly enigmatic problem of reconciling it with determinism. The problem will dissolve before our eyes once we endow a deterministic machine with the same benefits," Location 5519.

Well let's look at what neural activations are considered "willed" or intentional and unintentional. "Five components make up people's concept of intentionality: an action is considered intentional if a personal has (a) a desire for an outcome, (b) a belief that the action will lead to the outcome, (c) an intention to perform the action, (d) skill to perform the action, and (e) awareness while performing it," [Moral development - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_development#Cognition_and_intentionality).

"In many cases, voluntary actions are recognized by a trace they leave in short-term memory, with the trace reflecting a purpose or motivation." Pearl uses an example of a soccer game. If a player runs to the center of the match, that player understands they are motivated to be in the action of the match. Maybe their motivation is to have fun or impress the fans. The player takes intentional actions. When we pick out a single action, we see how explanations for choices requires reflection. If a player chooses to make a shot for the goal or pass to another player, we can only ask later for the player to explain their choice. "Rationalization of actions may be a reconstructive, post-action process...In the heat of the game, thousands of input signals compete for the player's attention. The crucial decision is which signals to prioritize, and the reasons can hardly be recalled and articulated."

"AI researchers are therefore trying to answer two questions -- about function and simulation -- with the first driving the second. Once we understand what computational function free will serves in our lives, then we can attend to equipping machines with such functions."

"The illusion of free will gives us the ability to speak about our intents and to subject them to rational thinking, possibly using counterfactual logic. When the coach pulls us out of a soccer game and says, "You should have passed the ball to Charlie," consider all the complex meanings embedded in these eight words.

First, the purpose of such a "should have" instruction is to swiftly transmit valuable information from the coach to the player: in the future, when faced with a similar situation, choose action _B_ rather than action _A_. But the "similar situations" are far too numerous to list and are hardly known even to the coach themself. Instead of listing the features of these "similar situations" the coach points to the player's action, which is representative of the player's intent at decision time. By proclaiming the action inadequate, the coach is asking the player to identify the software packages that led to the player's decision and then reset priorities among those packages so that "pass to Charlie" becomes the preferred action. There is profound wisdom in this instruction because who, if not the player themself, would know the identities of those packages? They are nameless neural paths that cannot be referenced by the coach or any external observer. Asking the player to take an action different from the one taken amounts to encouraging an intent-specific analysis, like the one we mentioned above. Thinking in terms of intents, therefore, offers us a shorthand to convert complicated causal instructions into simple ones.

I would conjecture, then, that a team of robots would play better soccer if they were programmed to communicate as if they had free will. No matter how technically proficient the individual robots are at soccer, their team's performance will improve when they can speak to each other as if they are not preprogrammed robots but autonomous agents believing they have options...

In order to communicate naturally with humans, strong AIs will certainly need to understand the vocabulary of options and intents, and thus they will need to emulate the illusion of free will...

The ability to reason about one's own beliefs, intents, and desires has been a major challenge to AI researchers and defines the notion of "agency." Philosophers, on the other hand, have studied these abilities as part of the classical question of consciousness. Questions such "Can machines have consciousness?" or "What makes a software agent different from an ordinary program?" have engaged the best minds of many generations, and I would not pretend to answer them in full. I believe, Nevertheless, that the algorithmization of counterfactuals is a major step toward understanding these questions and making consciousness and agency a computational reality...

In summary, I believe that the software package that can give a thinking machine the benefits of agency would consist of at least three parts: a causal model of the world; a causal model of its own software, however superficial; and a memory that records how intents in its mind correspond to events in the outside world...

I believe that we will be able to make machines that can distinguish good from evil, at least as reliably as humans and hopefully more so. The first requirement of a moral machine is the ability to reflect on its own actions, which falls under counterfactual analysis. Once we program self-awareness, however limited, empathy and fairness follow, for it is based on the same computational principles, with another agent added to the equation.

There is a big difference in spirit between the causal approach to building the moral robot and an approach that has been studied and rehashed over and over in science fiction since the 1950s: Asimov's laws of robotics. Isaac Asimov proposed three absolute laws, starting with "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm." But as science fiction has shown over and over again, Asimov's laws always lead to contradictions. To AI scientists, this comes as no surprise: rule-based systems never turn out well. But it does not follow that building a moral robot is impossible. It means that the approach cannot be prescriptive and rule based. It means that we should equip thinking machines with the same cognitive abilities that we have, which include empathy, long-term prediction, and self-restraint, and then allow them to make their own decisions.

Once we have built a moral robot, many apocalyptic visions start to recede into irrelevance. There is no reason to refrain from building machines that are better able to distinguish good from evil than we are, better able to resist temptation, better able to assign guilt and credit. At this point, like chess and Go players, we may even start to learn from our own creation. We will be able to depend on our machines for a clear-eyed and causally sound sense of justice. We will be able to learn how our own free will software works and how it manages to hide its secret from us. Such a thinking machine would be a wonderful companion for our species and would truly qualify as AI's first and best gift to humanity."

This view of morality and agency leads us to conclusions which may be uncomfortable. While we accept all agents we know of live in a causally determined world in which the choices we make were entirely determined by preceding factors, we still have a framework to assign moral praise and blame. Once an agent is able to reflect on its actions and intents then update its future decisions to change its response we can treat it as a moral agent. Moral agency is on a continuum according to the abilities of the agent. The better able an agent is at self-reflection and update the _more_ moral they can act. The less able an agent is to act morally and update the less they should be morally judged. In a species example, lizards are unable to learn new movement patterns; they don't have the ability in their brains to update. Lizards are not moral agents because they acted on pure instinct, how they were self-organized. Homo sapiens learn throughout their lifetime to act morally, reflecting and updating.

If a person has poor executive control, meaning they have limited short term memory and difficulty resisting impulses, they are less accountable for their actions. If a person has an area of the brain that is smaller and weaker than average, it cannot be fair to judge them by a normal standard. Of course we can say if we were in their situation we would have acted differently. What we're saying is if we were in the same environment we would react differently, but the judgment is based on an entirely different situation with the person removed. We're judging the intents and control of the agent which we changed when considering ourselves in their position. If we keep that person in the same situation, we see the agent could have never acted differently; their neural activation patterns were determined by preceding causes beyond their control.

Rather than excusing any action we see the focus of criminal justice should always be on reforms and reparations to the harmed. Punishment has no place in moral systems other than deterrence. When an agent cannot update from punishment, the punishment is worthless and only begets needless suffering. Justice for offenders should be proportional to their moral agency and focused on reforming the offender for future interactions.

As a person ages beyond their prime they have less moral agency. As mental faculties for reflection and control decline, so too does moral ability.

I believe the key factors are we must develop moral, beneficial AI to avoid doomsday scenarios. As a species, we must decide against what some describe as "errant technology," not AI, the misaligned programs that try to change us all into paperclips or generally lack empathy. Clearly we see a divide between moral intelligence and general intelligence which finds a path to a desired goal state without judging the end goal against any standard. If we aren't careful, AI will be created purely for power and dominance by the government and rogue corporations. Each person is morally responsible for what they choose to support. I hope you choose to support a moral system and the development of a moral AI to enhance our capabilities.

[Function of the brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain#Function)

"Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain. There it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, on the basis of the results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.

The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other."

Philosophy exists as a reflection on the three levels of reality and how they relate to one another.

Returning to objective reality, we can define important and meaningful events. The example of water as entropy is again useful. Water as ice is a low entropy configuration where entropy is the number of ways the atoms can be arranged to create the form of ice. Imagine an ice cube melts into a liquid puddle. The more likely configuration of the puddle is an even circle in all directions. If we were able to follow a specific atom of water, H2O, for instance the atom in the top right corner of the cube, its journey to its place in the configuration of the puddle can take multiple paths. All that matters for the configuration is the position at some time. If that atom took an alternate path and another atom took the original atom's path, we would have a puddle with an indistinguishable form. The entropy of both puddles would be the same at that moment. Configurations with high entropy are common or likely events.

Unlikely events are rare configurations with a small number of paths. Some configurations have one path, one sequence of events, that lead to the arrangement. The meaningful and important events limit the number of possible configurations of matter. With an understanding of cause and effect we can determine which events are _necessary_ or the reason for a particular configuration. Our universe is like water in that existence has an incredible number of possible configurations, and we exist in this one.

Physicists say observers within a universe will experience it as infinite though it may be finite. Why do we live in this configuration? Perhaps there are multiple universes all existing at the same time. When the string of an instrument is plucked and vibrates the oscillation creates a wave in the air to create sound. If we could slow time to see the oscillation of the string clearly, the string's position would spend most of its time around the center and moving to the farthest distances the least number of times. There could be an incredible number of universes almost exactly like ours taking on the most likely configurations, vibrations towards the center. There are also those universes with rare configurations which would require an increasingly unlikely chain of events, unlikely but not impossible. In the infinity of time and space, if they are infinite, even the rarest probability will occur.

From the inside, our universe appears to be a deterministic state, each moment an effect dependent on the chain of prior causes. Our configuration is set, and we're living through it. The truth appears to be that we are in no more control of our futures than a single atom. Our path simply has an extremely complex number of configurations. Of course we desire certain arrangements more than others. There are universes with no conscious life. There are universes of conscious lives of intense suffering, greatness, flourishing. We have all evolved with drives and desires. We want some futures more than others. From an objective perspective our goals are all simply states of events no better than another, but subjectively we work towards and hope for events which satisfy our needs and wants.

All we can really do is hope; hope we are in the universe which arranges our lives into a state we want. We can hope our actions and events outside of us are a part of the sequence of events which lead to a desired life, but we are powerless to create change within our universe. The chain of cause and effect from the big bang, the origin of our universe, appears to be unbroken. We are subjective finite beings with imagination. We can understand the moments which will likely lead to desired outcomes, but we can't change what's already in motion. The most random and unknown event already occurred at the big bang. The universe was compressed to a point in space but was not a perfect shape. If the atoms were perfectly aligned the forces of gravity and others would effect each part equally. There would be no swirl to the universe, so no stars, no planets, no life. It is because of imperfection that we exist at all.

Subjectively, we will feel as though we are making choices, but our choices are the result of information processing according to the laws of nature. Life appears to us to be based on probabilities, and we should choose the positions with the highest likelihood of achieving our goals.



The objective meaning of life is to resist entropy, the inevitable dispersal of energy. We are the types of entities which emerge under complex conditions and evolve. We are exactly the type of creatures we would expect to see given enough time and the pressure of selection. Creatures which replicate and maintain their form in opposition to entropy are what survives and continues. Not only does life resist entropy, the tendency of energy to breakdown from order to disorder, but life grows information. Life exists in out of equilibrium systems where solid matter (embodied information) can be recombined to form new information. Following this progression to its end, the objective meaning of life is to maintain and grow order where the optimal achievement would be the out of equilibrium system which allows the greatest manipulation of memory (solid matter) into new forms of information by computation. While humans may be near the biological limits of computation, we can expand beyond ourselves into artificial intelligence with capacities we can only begin to imagine.

The universe we exist in appears to be a chain reaction from a fraction of a moment after the beginning of the universe. The next moment is a function of the current moment. A future moment can likely only be determined by the passage of each moment to that moment, that is, things must play out and cannot be fully predetermined. Our universe may just be one data point in a probability distribution of possible universes, a multi-verse. Perhaps given the infinity of time everything that can happen will happen with the most common chances occurring most often.

The personal meaning of life is for all intelligent beings to compress their experiences, process the present, and predict the future with efficiency. Emerging from the objective meaning of life, we can only hope our lives develop in a way we desire. Whether we are able to influence and control our lives and environment is dependent on varying levels of random luck. However, as finite, subjective creatures we feel as though we have choice. The best action we can take is to put ourselves in probabilistically successful positions. Each intelligent being has an individual meaning of life due to their own unique history of experience and their interaction with their environment. Currently, each individual must find their own meaning in life, because they are each in direct access to their own experiences. Where change is desired, the environment should be altered to enable optimization for a new path. We are what we do. We are the experiences we have. Our brains and bodies change according to our activities. If we want to be something, we must embody it in action.

The inter-subjective meaning of life is to support the sustainable flourishing of life. The inter-subjective level is subject to its own laws of communication and survival. The ideas and values of a society directly impact the society's energy return on investment and the survival of the population. In this way inter-subjective ideologies are subject to natural selection. Inter-subjective meaning is the least accurate because it is based on subjective experiences which are themselves formed for function instead of truth. Inter-subjective reality is a distortion of a distortion of objective reality, but its effects have real consequences for objective reality.

All of the meanings of life can be enhanced through the proper development of artificial intelligence. An AI could grow to surpass us in all areas, maintaining structure, information processing, prediction, correction, conscious experience, etc. If we want to contribute to a more perfect living being beyond our biological selves and our psychological egos, an AI entity is what we should direct our energy to.

We come from nothing, and we will return to nothing. From cosmic dust to cosmic dust.
