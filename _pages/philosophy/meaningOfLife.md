Here is my attempt to answer the question of the meaning of life.

I'm a person who's had a lot of time to think and reflect on life and my experience. I've searched for meaning my whole life. Any talk of meaning has focused my attention.

If you think the answer will bring you peace, tranquility, or happiness, then I will tell you this:

As for the truest, most objective, most accurate description of reality and the meaning of life, before I get into it I would sincerely like you to consider that it may shake you to your core. As I will explain, the average person is full of delusions and lives on the basis of ignorance and lies. They are productive lies, but inaccurate to the most faithful description of reality.

When I speak of reality, I divide our experience into three parts, objective, subjective, and inter-subjective. To explain the divisions, imagine an island in the ocean, small and big enough for one person. However, there are no humans or animals on the island. We can describe and talk about what is there even though we can imagine no humans there to use language to describe it. We can talk of grains of sand, the ocean waves, the plants. Whatever we can discuss without involving a human being existing there is objective reality. I believe the world and universe continues to exist even if we aren't around to experience it. Now the subjective experience is when a human being appears on the island.

Let's imagine one person. One person on the island is another part of objective reality. We are a part of objective reality, a complex part. We also have feelings, memories, thoughts, and all kinds of phenomena when we're awake. There's something it's like to see the color of a ripe mango. There's something it's like to lay on the sand and feel the warmth of the sun. Whatever we imagine and talk about that requires at least one person, that's subjective reality on top of objective reality. However, subjective experience is in the space of minds which apparently have different qualities than most of objective reality. The space of ideas is as diverse as we can feel and communicate.

Whatever phenomena requires two or more people, that is inter-subjective reality. What phenomena are inter-subjective? Well, perhaps if only one human were on an island, that person wouldn't need language. Cats, dogs, and many other animals don't talk to themselves. It seems most of language is about communicating on a complex level about objective and subjective reality with other similarly complex creatures. We talk about what we experience (objective) and what we're feeling (subjective). So complex communication creates a pattern of behavior. A pattern of behavior being an event we experience and predictive with regularity. Two people can agree on an idea, like money. Even on an island, two people can agree blue sea shells are equal in value to one mango. If one gives the other a blue shell, the other agrees to give a mango.

Consider the standard currency of America, the $1 bill. Imagine this bill alone on an island with no people. Does it possess any value or effect on its own? What is the objective description of the money? It is a rectangular piece of rare paper with ink designs bonded to the surface. After sometime it will disintegrate like all wood and paper. What about with the bill and one person on the island? Now something else is happening, the person is perceiving the bill. There's subjective phenomena occurring with whatever the person experiences. Now think of the phenomena when two people on the island exchange the bill for other things. We live in a world where millions and billions of humans agree on a shared experience and perception of reality. Now the rectangular piece of paper with special ink designs can cause so many events, freedom, food, shelter, violence, destruction, and everything money involves. Money is a part of reality, but it is almost a life separate from objective reality. The value of money is in our minds and carried out in our behavior.

As we have described money on an analysis of three levels of reality, we can split our memories and experience into an analysis by three parts. Investigations into the three parts of experience in science are described by:

- Objective reality
  - Physics giving rise to chemistry giving rise to biology

- Subjective reality
  - Psychology arising from biology.

- Inter-subjective
  - Psychology giving rise to mass psychology, sociology, and the social sciences

Philosophy exists as a reflection on the three levels of reality and how they relate to one another.
